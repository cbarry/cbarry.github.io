I am a product manager focused on storefront ecommerce at [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com).

Before that, I worked on user acquisition and engagement at [Localytics](http://www.localytics.com/).

Before that, I worked at [athenahealth](http://www.athenahealth.com/).

I graduated from [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu/) in May 2012. I focused my coursework and time/energy on technology entrepreneurship.

I worked on Peddl -- the easiest way to buy and sell things from the people around you. We were a finalist in the MIT $100K Business Plan Contest in 2012, and we won the mobile track.

I was also a co-founder at Meater, a mobile biotech platform to detect illness in beef cattle. We were [finalists in MIT $100K ACCELERATE](http://mit100k.org/accelerate/semi-finalists/meater/) in 2011. I still think that data and analytics will change how agribusiness works.

I spent the summer between my first and second years of graduate school at [athenahealth](http://www.athenahealth.com) doing process innovation (product management) for [athenaClinicals](http://www.athenahealth.com/practice/athenaclinicals), a cloud-based electronic health record app.

In my first year of business school, I took a class called [Entrepreneurship Lab](http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/elab-student-information) at the [MIT Sloan School](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/) that gave me the opportunity to work with [QD Vision](http://www.qdvision.com/), a nanomaterials startup.

Before that, I was an infantry officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. I was in [2d Battalion, 3d Marines](http://www.mcbh.usmc.mil/3mar/2dbn/2-3%20INDEX.htm) in Kaneohe Bay, HI. My battalion deployed to Karmah, Iraq, and southern Afghanistan. When I lived in Hawaii, I enjoyed scuba diving and trail running. I left active duty in August 2010 and began my MBA two weeks later.

Before that, I went to [Dartmouth College](http://www.dartmouth.edu). I majored in economics and philosophy. I was the president of [The Dartmouth](http://www.thedartmouth.com), a daily newspaper that is the oldest college paper in America. [The Dartmouth](http://www.thedartmouth.com) is NOT the same thing as the Dartmouth Review.

I wrote code for the [U.S. Navy](http://www.nrl.navy.mil/) (probabilistic neural networks!) and [CGI](http://www.cgi.com/en/home) (back when it was AMS), and I started a catchily-named web development shop with a friend. I went to high school at [St. Albans School](http://www.stalbansschool.org/) in Washington, DC.
