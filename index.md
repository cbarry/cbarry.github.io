My name is Colin Barry. I am interested in building products that solve hard problems and that people enjoy.

I currently work on the storefront product management team at [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com). Before that, I built user acquisition and engagement tools for mobile apps at [Localytics](https://www.localytics.com/). Sometimes, I blogged about the [stuff my team built](http://info.localytics.com/blog/author/colin-barry). Before that, I worked on clinical integration and healthcare interoperability for [athenahealth](https://www.athenahealth.com).

 

#### _wait, so what is this?_

Mostly a compilation of class notes I took as an MBA student. [Scott Snook](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=164841) once mentioned that the greatest regret of his MBA experience was not forcing himself to write down "what I learned today" after each day of b-school. So at the beginning of my second year, I started writing down what I learned after every class session. I was fortunate enough to take classes taught by [Michael Porter](/tags/microeconomics-of-competitiveness/), [Clay Christensen](/tags/building-and-sustaining-successful-enterprises/), and [Tom Eisenmann](/tags/launching-technology-ventures/) (among many others).

I decided to blog what I learned because there is some [compelling](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mar.20316) [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence:_Science_and_Practice#Commitment_and_consistency) about the power of public commitments to incent people to accomplish their goals. Basically, if you tell all your friends that you will lose 10 pounds or write a novel or start a business, the probability that you will actually do so increases dramatically.
