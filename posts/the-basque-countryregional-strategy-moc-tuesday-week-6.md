Sources of prosperity:\
-- Endowments: location, ports, iron ore\
-- "Autonomy"\
-- Stable legal system, open to trade, good infrastructure\
-- SMALL (~2M people)\
-- Consistent regional strategy => did not change course every four years based on election cycle, etc.

Sectoral plans vs. cluster plans\
-- Businesses will pay attention to sectoral plans, but only to get government money\
-- Need biz leaders to organize cluster initiatives themselves => lots of benefit lies in fostering collaboration between cluster's firms

I still don't understand why biotech and nanotech and cleantech make sense for the Basque Country of the 21st century --- seems like wishful thinking, not logical outgrowth of endowments and existing institutions
