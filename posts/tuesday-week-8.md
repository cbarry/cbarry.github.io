Types of board members: insiders, angels, VCs, industry experts\
Industry experts sometimes able to lend perspective to squabbles; no skin in the game.

The wider world: new venture sees their relationship with VC associate/partner who sits on board.\
They do not see performance of other VC portfolio companies, VC's internal politics, or VC's relationship with LPs.\
Result: lots going on in the minds of investors that new venture does not understand.

When do VC-funded startups get first non-founding CEO?\
25% by close of the A round, 38% by close of the B round, 52% by close of the C round.
