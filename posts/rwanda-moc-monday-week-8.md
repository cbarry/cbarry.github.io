Macroeconomic strategy is really hard sometimes. Post-genocide, basically the only thing Rwanda has going for it is that the entire world feels sorry for them. Incredible progress over the last 18 years...

Government of National Unity strategy (94-00): - SECURITY - Macro policy: curb inflation - Political institutions: basic gov't, reconciliation

In 2010: - Zero corruption - Prioritizing improvement in infrastructure, logistics - Still trouble attracting FDI... - Dual imperative: maintain security/stability, open up to world/attract FDI
