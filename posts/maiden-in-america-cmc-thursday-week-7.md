Maidenform and the development/commercialization of the bra: A positive example of what emerged from rapid urbanization and social/economic transformation in American cities. Compare to Al Capone... Also, one of the first examples of highly successful female entrepreneurship in America.

[Ida Rosenthal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_Rosenthal): Jewish immigrant from Minsk, lands in NYC Lucky? And incredibly savvy. Builds company with $4K of invested capital. Takes charge of finances and marketing; husband does product design And still pays herself less than her husband and makes William Rosenthal the company's President (Commentary: "Please let him earn more money than I do -- you might not understand that now but believe me, you will one day. Otherwise, that's a recipe for disaster." - Alex Goran, 'Up in the Air,' on finding the right husband. Enduring stereotypes...)

Also, a product of NYC: Garment district/fashion cluster Changing role of women; business in the home = possible Geographic density, cheap labor

Still, constant tension between pioneering role of women/challenging stereotypes VS. selling product in a male-dominated world: Sales force is all-male William takes charge of company on paper Even at the start, advertising tone is aspirational/wishy-washy (I think) => "I dreamed..." vs. "I am..." Corporate culture: pin-up of the month => selling sex/desire from men from the start (I think)

Succession in family businesses is tough: Maidenform bankruptcy/restructuring in the late 90s/00s.
