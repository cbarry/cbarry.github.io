Course summary? That's what I've been doing all along... Many of my classmates are way smarter than me: [http://launchingtechventures.blogspot.com/](http://launchingtechventures.blogspot.com/)

Some key points/thoughts:

Develop specific, falsifiable hypotheses Falsifiable: can be rejected via testing Specific: "Viral coefficient > 0.4" NOT "Product will spread via WoM" Measurable: quantitative measures (if possible)

MVP thoughts: - Reduce product functionality to test hypotheses => MVP does necessarily mean a "bad" product; sometimes just an incomplete product - Rely on temporary/makeshift measures => Mechanical Turk, etc. - Smoke tests (as appropriate) - Consider risk of false positives and false negatives
