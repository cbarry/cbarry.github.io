Why has South Carolina stayed poor? - Agricultural history - Losing jobs in textiles and apparel - Bad educational/human capital base

Traditional South Carolina growth strategy: - "pro-business" environment - cheap labor - recruit big manufacturing firms with tax incentives - emphasize technical education

Why this doesn't work: - Subsidies are costly. State tax rate is significantly higher than national average (17.7% vs. 15%); tax incentives to big firms get paid for by local businesses/citizens. - Attract the wrong kind of firms: sensitive to labor costs = won't invest in human development - Doesn't address roads, schools, other fundamentals - There is always someone cheaper (globally) Overall, focus on individual companies, not state competitiveness.

So why did South Carolina do this? - Diversify away from dying industries - Jobs = politicians' success metric - Tax incentives are not as visible to constituency as infrastructure spending - SHORT TERM VICTORIES = what politicians love

So how well as the New Carolina Initiative performed? Positives: some cluster organization, some state agency involvement, education/training metrics improved, foundation laid (?). Negatives: still low per-capita income, still bad education, senior government leaders are uninvolved/skeptical, textiles are still bleeding. Complicated by '08 recession, and only really six or seven years old...
