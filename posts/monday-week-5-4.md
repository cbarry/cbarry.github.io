Think about importance of anchoring in drafting early/informal founder's agreements. Do early agreements suggest even split or allow for more nuanced allocation of equity?

How UpDown negotiation actually worked: founding team met in pairs, avoided confrontation between Phuc and Georg that might have disrupted team dynamics.

Vesting is a hard conversation to have (sort of like a pre-nuptial) but incredibly important. Even if only because the future is unpredictable (Georg ended up not getting a visa; unable to continue as co-founder through no fault of his own).
