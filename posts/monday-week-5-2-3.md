What is financial analysis? Identify key drivers of performance => assess past/present performance => determine whether firm is achieving its goals

Starts with understanding firm strategy (business model, risks, unique characteristics, competitors, lifecycle) and accounting choices. ==> If accounting choices do not reflect objectives/risks, maybe we should adjust to capture reality "better."

Other hints for ratio analysis: - Be careful about changes in firm's operations over time -- one-time items, new strategies, etc. - Cross-sectional analysis (firm vs. competitors) -- Do firms in the same industry have the same strategy? Sometimes, but often not... - Some items are often troublesome/hard to "bucket" (convertible securities on B/S, deferred taxes)

Thoughts on commodity firms - Need to understand/scrutinize cyclicality and utilization => central to valuation - Often huge changes in revenue without much change in assets - Macro perspective/factors = usually significant - Non-obvious insight: Commodity producers can do great when input prices rise IF demand is strong and supply/capacity is tight. Pass factor price increases on to customers...
