Three key activities in every search process: breadth, search, interaction (BSI)

For any search activity, there are three basic models. You can find potential spouses via: Your social network: Activities (work, school) =====> bad breadth (small pool, homogenous) =====> easy search (good knowledge about potential partners) =====> easy interaction (already many excuses to talk)

Others' networks: Brokered (friends, parents) =====> okay breadth (bigger pool than your own acquaintances) =====> okay search (rely on others decision-making) =====> okay interaction (broker can help determine potential partner's interest/availability)

Chance: Bars (or walking down the street, etc.) =====> excellent breadth =====> bad search (hard to discern compatibility/"quality") =====> bad interaction (hard to "make a move"/creepy, social repercussions, gender norms, etc.)

In online dating ====> Facebook = Activity, eHarmony = Brokered, Match/OkCupid = Bars. Corollary: if you see a search process where one of these three classes of interaction does not exist, it's a business opportunity.

eHarmony Key Factors to Success: - High barriers to entry (long survey, expensive fee, reject "bad" applicants) - Matching algorithm (better matches \[?\], limited choices = easier to pick, lessens social stigma of reaching out) - Limited communication (avoids feast-or-famine problems \[women with attractive photos get deluged with messages\], increases odds of a response \[because the other party doesn't have tons of choice either\]) - Guided Communication (answer important questions \[location? kids?\] early)

But you still need bodies on the platform! And tons of challenges with marketing -- dating is scary/uncertain. Compare with picking a hair-care product: "If you want to buy shampoo, the shampoo bottle is like, 'Uh-huh, I'm going home with you!'" - Misiek

Word-of-mouth advertising doesn't work well; no one wants to tell their friends they are using an online dating service... So customer acquisition cost tends to be very high: ad spend for big sites on the order of 40% of revenue.
