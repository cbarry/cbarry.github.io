Vital Amines (or, "what's still missing if we understand disruption") - Where is "the edge of the earth?" Probably there is some limit to the level of innovation a company should pursue. Where does it lie? What types of innovations will actually never work for me/my company? Example: Should Intel NBI have created salesforce.com or NetFlix? Probably not.

\- Why do some firms with "disruptive potential" beat out others? Example: There were hundreds of Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers in the late 80s/early 90s. There are currently three with 90-something percent market share -- Asustek, Acer, and HTC. What did they do different? One thought: "deep dives" => CEOs and key managers spent 5% of time on existing businesses and 70% on new businesses. If you have good processes for sustaining core business, best people should not focus on the core business. You need them to develop new processes for new businesses...

\- What the heck do you do if you're a smart low-level employee at a firm that is messing up? I.e. You're a junior guy at Intel and you see ARM/mobile on the horizon. You know it's going to kill Intel in 10 years if you don't do anything. What can you really do? My Answer: Leave Intel, start a business around ARM... Ironic, because the class is called "Building and Sustaining Successful Enterprises."
