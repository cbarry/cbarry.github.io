Is this a good fit?\
Pros:\
-- U.S. market entry for Schneider\
-- Square D = mostly residential, Schneider = mostly industrial\
-- Economies of scale (R&D)\
-- Distribution channels

Cons:\
-- Hostile!\
-- Competing standards => how good will synergies be?\
-- At what price?\
-- Earnings impact for Schneider (goodwill amortization)\
-- Not a clear turnaround opportunity: Square D mgmt is good

Seemingly innocuous assumptions can have serious consequences:\
Lazard DCF valuation for Square D connects sales to change in long-term assets, NOT level of long-term assets. Model projects long-term depreciation (as a percentage of sales) below CAPEX (as a percentage of sales)...so we end up with a massive asset base.\
Takeaway: you probably need to forecast out the balance sheet...

Think about assumptions embedded in the market price of a stock. Large portion of Square D equity value is based on presumed synergies from a merger/M&A premium.
