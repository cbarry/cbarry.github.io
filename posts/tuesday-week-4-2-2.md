Mostly personal takeaways.

\- It is really easy to get lazy about testing assumptions. It's one thing to say that you're Lean, but nobody actually wants to get proven wrong... - Expose yourself and your plan to ridicule. - Benefits of explaining your business model from a blank sheet of paper => surfaces implicit assumptions; useful even if you are convinced that your unique insight (ha-ha) is correct. - Facts exist outside the building => I already believed it, but speculating about a business model for two hours makes it so much more obvious. - "My hypothesis can't be tested" is always wrong. It might take more creativity than Google AdWords. But if I wanted to found another me-too e-commerce startup, I wouldn't decorate the walls of my bedroom with Randy Komisar quotations.
