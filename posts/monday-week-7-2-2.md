Intel's switch from DRAM to microprocessors: from the outside, looks like new market disruption. But actually driven by pursuit of higher margin: resource allocation process drives production of more profitable microprocessors.

Way to think about Intel => microprocessors came out of emergent strategic process; but re-framed as a sustaining innovation.\

Recommendation: separate resource allocation process for emergent projects from RAP for deliberate projects. Maybe just draw up arbitrary divide (30% emergent, 70% deliberate) because otherwise deliberate will usually take resources from emergent.
