"Historically, investments made during recessions have delivered some of the best returns." - some Bessemer Venture Partners report

Ordinary downturns in the business cycle can (relatively easily) turn into a depression. Tradeoff versus "letting things play out" and "regulatory authority" ==> clearly the optimum is somewhere in the middle

Why did Irving Fisher -- the greatest economist of his generation -- miss the Great Depression? Or, why did a bunch of smart people think that the late 1920s run-up was "the new normal?" (Comment: stop me if this seems eerily similar to rhetoric around 2000/2008) - Radical tech changes ====> electricity, communications, internal combustion engine ====> "different from the past" ====> new R&D capabilities inside firms ====> emerging giants: GE, RCA ====> hard to value R&D and firms' intellectual property

\- Management practice changes ====> Scientific management ====> New, more efficient organization methods for firms

\- Labor utilization/relations ====> virtuous circle: higher standard of living creates more demand creates better firms, etc.

Reasons for the Crash (1) Federal Reserve response => tighten credit, send contradictory messages (2) Leverage => one-third of individual investors trading on margin; downturn forces margin calls and mass liquidation (3) Overproduction => problems forecasting demand; overinvestment in capital goods (4) Gold standard => interest rates rise, gold flows out of U.S. (5) Low barriers to stock ownership => fuels bubble in equity prices (6) Inflexible banking sector => tons of tiny banks; regulations against interstate banking
