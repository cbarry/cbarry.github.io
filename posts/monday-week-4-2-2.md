Systematic and focused hypothesis testing at the outset: - Will women rent? - Will women rent without seeing dresses? - Will women damage dresses? BUT equally important "customer interview" type function ==>> early tests give founders insight into how customers are using product: aspirational purchase; selling "Cinderella for a night" - RTR raised seed money BEFORE several key tests. Was this actually a Lean startup? In hindsight, it worked out swimmingly...

Jenn/Jenny thoughts: - New customer behavior = challenging. People need reassurance and "social proof" before they do new things. ==>> RTR customers need 7 or 8 "touchpoints"/interactions with with the brand to feel comfortable with the model. Recommendation from a friend, advertising, news stories, etc. - RTR is primarily a marketing company. Renting is not inherently cool -- RTR needs to feel like renting a Ferrari, not renting a Chevy. Virality depends on customer's willingness to talk about renting her dress from RTR. - Products as marketing => Drop an extra $1.5K handbag in the shipping box with a dress rental: customer shows off bag and talks about experience, drive virality.
