The Buy Story for Sino-Forest:\
-- Better than competitors\
-- Incredibly growth, booming demand\
-- Good relationship with Chinese government

How good are the financial statements?\
Lots of negatives:\
-- Unclear how they make money.\
-- Unclear how to value assets: impairment factors? control over assets?\
-- Huge jump in A/R, concentrated customers, weird customers ("Affiliated Intermediaries").\
-- No allowance for doubtful accounts.\
-- Related-party transactions.\
-- Weird tax position.\
BUT:\
-- Tons of cash ($1.2B)\
-- Solid operating cash flow

Two sources of uncertainty:\
GOVERNANCE: auditor moral hazard, Canadian accounting firm.\
FINANCIALS: How good is earnings quality? Will revenue convert to cash?

Big takeaway:\
Earnings quality analysis can raise concerns. But concerns are different from fraud allegations, and we usually can't discern fraud from financial statements alone.
