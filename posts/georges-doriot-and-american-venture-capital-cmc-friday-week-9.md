Why did the VC model arise post-WWII? - Hard for small, risky firms to access capital => banks won't lend - Revenue Act of 1940 => higher taxes, probably doesn't deter investment but greater need for individual investors to pool risk - US Government funding for war R&D => de-risks follow-on investment - US Government created wartime partnerships between universities and industry - GI Bill => higher ed is more broadly accessible

Georges Doriot: HBS professor, American soldier, visionary investor - Firm believer in possibility of managing entrepreneurship - Dispenses money AND advice - Already had created a pool of analysts (HBS students) - "Central node" => deep industry connections, networker - Portfolio theory

American Research and Development Corporation (ARD) - founded in 1946 - Shifts industry focus with the times: chemicals => diverse sector choices => electronics - Access to capital: lots of individual investors, permanent fund (closed-end) - Portfolio management: takes controlling stake in enterprises and actively manages (board seats) - Capital gains and consulting fees (looks more like contemporary PE, but they also started off with less risky investments/more hits than modern VC)

The big deal about ARD: foresight to invest on an unproven thesis Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC): ARD invests in 1957, IPO in 1961, 81% IRR/375x returns over 10 years. Proves the model...

Subsequent evolution in VC firm structure: ARD: - sells shares at Net Asset Value on public markets (like an ETF) - investors have liquidity via secondary market - General Partners are salaried

Limited Partnerships: - 10 year fund lifetime (usually), limited liquidity - GPs earn fee (2%) and carried interest (20%) - Unequal distribution of fund upside among GPs (older GPs make more, usually) BUT hard to retain good GPs; easy to break off and start another fund once you have a reputation...

Increasingly, trend away from "royalty model" of compensation and towards "insurance model" - Junior partners see a piece of the upside - Decreases attrition of good GPs, allows VC firms to build a brand. Helps explain persistence of returns??
