Franchising = big business, not studied much at HBS.

Franchisors:\
-- Leverage local knowledge of managers who are aligned with system and passionate/motivated\
-- Maintain control (or keep a lot of equity, at least)

Franchisees:\
-- Tradeoff between getting great terms and getting a great, proven system\
-- Paul Guy ended up with a 1-800-GOT-TRASH franchise for the entire city of Toronto (biggest city in Canada) --- either impossible or insanely costly if he hadn't been the first franchisee...
