How big was the dot-com bubble? August 1995 (day before Netscape IPO) -- NASDAQ at 1,005 March 2000 (peak of the bubble) -- NASDAQ at 5,132 Yesterday -- NASDAQ at 3,068

Is Pets.com a good opportunity? - Category killer (race to get scale, realize economies) - High gross margin, low net margin because bricks-and-mortar is costly - Recurring revenue >> Rewards to first mover (theoretically); winner-take-all <<

Is this really a winner-take-all business? Maybe -- see also, Amazon.

Concerns: Competitive dynamics (destructive rivalry between petstore.com and pets.com) Do consumers need to see/touch pet food and supplies? Margin / weight (Commentary: I did not find this implausible) Network effects? Loyalty? (Commentary: I did not find this implausible)

Lots of grousing about specific assumptions in the business plan. (Commentary: Totally misses the point -- basic thesis in early-stage venture is that a smart team with a plausible business model and a big market will figure out how to win. At the beginning, Pets.com team made a reasonably compelling case that CAC Macro perspective: Tons of value evaporated when dot-com bubble exploded. Maybe. Huge benefit to society in reducing the cost of IT and e-commerce. Lots of busts, several huge wins. (Commentary: Not even that many busts -- the case posits that around 60% of bubble-era startups failed, which is much lower than the 90% failure rate that people expect for tech startups today.).
