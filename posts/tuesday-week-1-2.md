Salary negotiation => some considerations - What do I want besides money? (strong ties with mentor; communicate confidence in myself) - Comparables (justification; reference point) - Long-term considerations (anchor value for the future)

One perspective: [![](images/comp-graph-300x247.jpg "comp graph")](http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/comp-graph.jpg)

Sales jobs => commission structure usually more of the norm (low-high; "trusting hero")

Common mistake: salary negotiation can be a test; might be smart to leave a little bit on the table

Big three job search mistakes: (1) Not relying on your full interest set - Bias towards measurement ($) - Bias on the short-term (first-year compensation) - Lack of introspection

(2) Ignoring recruiter's interests - As a recruiter (HR in big company) - As a boss/partner - As a manager (offer letters set a precedent for compensation within company)

(3) Transactional vs. repeated game - If you take the job, you have to work at the company. NOT a one-off negotiation.
