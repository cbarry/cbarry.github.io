How do rich kings do it? - Industries/business models that are wide open (Apple) - Finding a "third path" (effective balance between creating value and keeping control) - Started early - Geography arbitrage? Take a proven business model and apply it somewhere else (Babies.com in Brazil)

Recovering from mistakes: - "Inertia" approach => persistence; just keep on keeping on (Savage Beast/Pandora) - Reactive approach => hit the 'undo' key (Brian Scudamore at Rubbish Boys) - Proactive approach => build firewalls, craft dynamic agreements (Genevieve Theirs at Sittercity) Some class discussion around the superiority of the proactive approach. I am not entirely convinced; I think it's way harder to be "proactive" than people think and then we are unwilling to make hard decisions/hit 'undo'/admit error in embarrassing ways.

Noam's Life Lessons: - The ladder of success is actually a roller-coaster, not a ladder. - Pick a career that makes you excited to get out of bed.

Don't postpone doing good until after you "make it." [![](images/learn-earn-return-300x225.jpg "learn-earn-return")](http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/learn-earn-return.jpg)
