Victor Frankl (author of "Man's Search for Meaning"): "78% of American youngsters are most concerned with finding meaning and purpose in life." Upshot: most people are not materialistic and grabby, despite appearances. "Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should be, and he will become as he can and should be." - Goethe

Why think about a leadership purpose: makes the journey of life meaningful. Practical answer => Without a purpose, why would anyone follow you? Without a purpose that is larger than you, you're just at the mercy of your ego.

"This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy." - George Bernard Shaw

Example purposes: "Eliminate chaos!" "Bring water and power to the two billion people who don't have it." "Lead soldiers!"
