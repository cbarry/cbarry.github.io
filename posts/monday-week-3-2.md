On calling his parents in graduate school to ask for money:\
"It was Berkeley in 1968 --- can you imagine what the money was used for?" -- H. Takeuchi

Japanese maxim about quality:\
kei haku tan sho = light, thin, short, small

Protectionist policies (tariffs, etc.) often end up reducing rivalry among domestic producers. Usually bad if you actually want to an industry to export stuff...

Japanese MITI/aggressive targeting of specific industries => didn't work that well; lots of cases where "strategic" industries didn't get off the ground (aerospace). Fax was not encouraged OR discouraged.
