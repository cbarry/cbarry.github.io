Johari's window model of thinking about self knowledge:\
![Johari's Window via Wikipedia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Johari_Window.PNG)\
Opening the window = expanding the arena (a.k.a. "open") portion through self-disclosure and feedback-seeking.

Generally, bias of ALD is towards disclosing more about yourself.\
BUT need to think about boundaries/impacts, and be pragmatic and intentional about disclosure.

Formula for self-disclosure: (1) what I have withheld, (2) why I have withheld it, and (3) why I am telling you this now.
