In the throes of the Great Depression, DuPont announces -- with great fanfare -- that they have invented a somewhat-better synthetic version of rubber. Rubber prices are at rock-bottom. What the heck?

Just how bad was the Great Depression? GDP down 26%, 1929-1931 Unemployment > 15% Stock market down 73% (1929-1931) 3,300 banks failed (1929-1931)

DuPont invests in basic R&D -- yields neoprene, nylon, plutonium, etc. Pros to investing at the time: - Attract good scientists, set a precedent - Experimentation (stage investment in new products) - Profuse opportunities (obvious at the time?) - Sitting on cash ($20M) - Human capital is cheap - R&D: winner-take-all?

Cons: - No goals for R&D - Too speculative, not applied, no clear endstate (ex ante) - Need $44M to commercialize neoprene - Diffusion of new products will be slower than usual => delay R&D? - DuPont makes intermediate goods: need demand from other businesses

Why could DuPont do this? Specific capabilities/competencies: - Organizational structure => M-Form corporation - History of product success => appetite for long-term commitment - Bridgewater, et al => experienced midlevel leaders capable of commercializing science - Advertising expertise

Internal DuPont memo on basic research (Stine). Key points: - Pure academic research (not necessarily applied) => may NOT lead to practical applications - Internal culture benefits - Proprietary tech - Pipeline to feed new biz Still proves tough to manage over the long haul.

Bipolar before, but...
