Goals in Central American integration: - Foster stability - Common markets - Focus on economics - Pursue win-win opportunities - Voluntary - Maintain national sovereignty - Loose structure, no funding

Goals in European integration: - Avoid future wars - Long-term vision of united Europe - Give up some sovereignty - Treaties, institutions, budget! - Restive: slow growth vs. USA

\>>> Steps along the way <<< European Coal & Steel Community ('52): Create economic interdependence in strategic resource Avoid further Franco-German wars over Ruhr and Alsace-Lorraine

Treaties of Rome ('57/'58): Fix tariff policy Institutionalize single market in goods, cap subsidies to "national champion" firms

European Monetary System ('79): After Bretton Woods, need currency stability and limits on devaluation (distort growth)

Single Europe Act/Common Market ('86): Fix non-tariff policies Open trade in services, people, and capital; remove non-tariff barriers (NTBs) BUT need to compensate poor countries for inability to protect nascent industries

Maastricht ('92): European social and political unification Free capital movement...but weaker countries get cheap money!

And then it goes off the rails... Lisbon Agenda ('00): Catch up on productivity growth, fix labor inflexibility

What goes wrong? Integration fatigue? - Moral suasion only, opt-out is possible - Threatens sovereignty - Diversity/number of members - More competition based on wages/taxes - Immigration - More "center-left" governments

So what happens now? Definitely: more fiscal coordination, simplify EU institutions, mutual recognition of training/job qualifications

BUT: More integration? "Bigger is better." >>>> OR <<<< Dis-aggregate? Smaller = more accountable, focus on integration issues not country-specific issues.
