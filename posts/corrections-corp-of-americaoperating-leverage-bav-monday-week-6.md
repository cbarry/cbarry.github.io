Business Analysis: Mix of managed (asset-lite) & owned-and-managed (asset-heavy) Looks like a cross between hotel and defense industries => occupancy-managed = critical

Sources of growth: many macro factors/odd risks (political, government fiat, etc.)

Financial Analysis: Drivers = unit revenue, unit margins, capacity, utilization

Greatest sources of uncertainty/focus of effort: amount of PP&E (capacity), utilization rate.
