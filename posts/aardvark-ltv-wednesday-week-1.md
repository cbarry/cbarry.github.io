Was Aardvark a "lean startup?" Yes: hypothesis-driven, frequent smoke tests, high frequency of release, lots of prototyping (Mechanical Turk) No: prioritized user acquisition, NOT hypothesis-driven (vision/persistence vs. arrogance/refusal to take feedback?)

Is Aardvark really viral? NO! - Not a game. - Not clear social value for users to share (no ego gain, like Quora or Klout) - No inherent incentives to share. - No social extensions/integration with social platforms.

Perennial lean startup challenge: - Founders pick a business model they like. - Hypothesis testing: Hard to differentiate between legitimate affirmation and false positives. - Hard to keep testing core "big assumptions"

"Talent hits a target no one else can hit; genius hits a target no one else can see." - Schopenhauer (via Jeff Bussgang)

Jon Chim on Aardvark: - "Startups live hand to mouth." => Can't possibly test everything; stage investment accordingly - Aardvark spent 30-40% of engineering effort on enabling A/B testing and metric collection => You need to design everything around making tests possible

\- Testing: "We would get four users every week off the street (via Craigslist post). We had users before we knew what we were even testing."

\- Hired engineers who didn't know how to code. => It causes trouble when you look at a problem and start thinking, "I know how to solve this..." and then immediately start building.

\- It's hard to separate timing/implementation from the idea in hypothesis-testing. Especially in network-effects businesses... Did your test fail because the idea was bad, or because you didn't market well enough/have enough users for the product to be valuable when you ran the test?
