More on three-factor model for valuation: tie assumptions about asset intensity and profit margin to expected changes in business model in the future. Example: firm plans expand sales channels from telemarketing to retail stores. Asset intensity will probably increase.

Recapitalization: substituting debt for equity in a firm's capital structure. Often part of LBOs, but a great option if management/early investors wants some liquidity without selling equity to outsiders, doing an IPO, etc.
