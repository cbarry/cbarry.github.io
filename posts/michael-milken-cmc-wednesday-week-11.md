Michael Milken: savior of American growth or common criminal?

America in the 1970s/80s:\
-- Deregulation, shift from manufacturing to service economy\
-- Poorly-run large companies (maybe)\
-- Future growth: small, riskier companies\
-- Inflation drops in early '80s\
=== Trend: Replacement Cost > Market Value ===\
-- Discount factor => Stock market is undervalued? Complacent big companies? Suboptimal capital structures?\
-- Focus on high agency costs => Notion of "shareholder value" develops, backlash against managerial complacency. Decline of managerial capitalism??

And so, junk bonds:\
Serve investor with higher risk appetite; betting on credit risk, not interest rates\
Drexel takes the lead as market-maker\
MILKEN => foresight to realize that smaller firms need access to debt

Sounds great. So what goes wrong?\

How does Milken maintain power?\
-- Charisma, personal loyalty, cult of personality\
-- He makes money for EVERYONE\
-- Informational advantage\
-- Due diligence capability, pricing\
-- Network\
-- Underwriting: Drexel buys full issue\
-- ONE-MAN MARKET

Consequences:\
Presages rise of financial instruments.\
Wave of MBOs and LBOs.\
Decline of old-style managerial capitalism\
Democratization of capital ... and then the savings and loan crisis.
