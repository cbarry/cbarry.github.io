Modeling growth =>> decompose into:\
Sources of top-line growth (new stores, new tech, geographic expansion, higher same-store sales, etc.)\
Sources of bottom-line growth (efficiency, new higher-margin products, reduced shipping costs, etc.)

Forecasting balance sheets =>> break into four parts (NWC, LT Assets, Net Debt, Common Equity):\
-- Scale NWC as a percentage of sales (or something)\
-- Add planned CAPEX into LT Assets\
-- Assume no increase in debt (or build in plans for more debt)\
-- Move net income from forecasted I/S into Common Equity\
====>>>> Resolve (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) by paying a dividend or changing Net Debt
