The singular necessary and sufficient condition for a company is customers.

Useful tool: customer personas -- Freddy the Frustrated Data Center Manager, Tina the Technology-Averse Nurse, etc. Base on real customer interviews, include lots of biographical details to add color.

Crossing the chasm (technology push business models): look for easiest customer to please. Best customers are well-funded and readily accessible to sales force, with compelling reason to buy. You (and your partners) should ideally be able to deliver a whole product.

"Become one with your customers." - Bill Aulet
