U.S. Government asks Crosley Corp. to commercialize the proximity fuze. Should they?

Yes: - Government-funded R&D, no risk - In line with core competencies - Reputation benefits - Improve relationship with government => makes business sense as war approaches ==> Moral responsibility/duty to country? <==

No/concerns: - Massive investment in capacity - Tech risk - Relationship w/ gov't => big, demanding customer ==> Ethics of manufacturing war materials? <==

I was not touched by the supposed ethical issues. They're not making Agent Orange...

"Business" model: government-driven innovation NDRC (independent non-profit intermediary) => Divisions => Sections (labs) Coordinate R&D with: Universities Who coordinate manufacturing/assembly with: Private-sector firms

\=> Private firms give up some upside => Government involvement defrays risk, enables real commitment by private sector => Moral imperative/just cause

Consequences: Fuzes in 1942 = $732 Fuzes in 1945 = $18

Shockingly efficient; incredibly rapid progress from idea to actual product. Could this work in other industries/sectors? Cleantech? Our intuition is to say government should leave everything to the private sector. But sometimes other models seem to work very well...
