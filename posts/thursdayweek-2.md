Raw cotton => Ginned (removes seeds) => Carded (breaks up clumps) => Combed (straighten) => Spun (make yarn) => Weave (make cloth)

If you think today's arguments about IP protection/patent enforcement are new and different, you are totally wrong.\
-- Constant tension between jump-starting an industry/diffusion of tech/prosperity for the masses vs. protecting innovation/incentivizing discovery\
-- People talking about patenting algorithms (for designing manufacturing set-ups) in the early 19th century\
-- Conflict between developed countries (England) and developing (America) over IP rights against backdrop of global competitiveness/nationalism

Close relationship between production and marketing/sales is relatively new.\
Prior to Lowell company, manufacturers just produced a ton of cloth without regard for demand.\
>> Made a mint in good times\
>> Ended up with ridiculous oversupply in bad times\
>> Little ability to foresee/react to exogenous shocks.

US vs. UK in cloth => vertical integration vs. modularity/intermediation\
Slater: Centralized spinning, de-centralized weaving.\
Lowell: "Put your looms where your mills are, bro."\
If handoffs are costly/inefficient (and they were), vertical integration is probably the way to go.
