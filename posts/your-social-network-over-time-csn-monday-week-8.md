I am a poor judge of social need.

People don't have many close friends. - Survey in 2004: 25% of Americans do not have someone they can talk to about serious personal issues (close friend). - Trend over past 25 years or so: more people are good friends with their spouse, fewer people have friends other than their spouse. - Best predictor of your number of close friends: years of education. ==> Corollary: Well-educated, high-income people often have bad personal intuition about the value proposition of social media. Because they already have friends... ==> Other corollary: Minorities (racial, ethnic, sexual, etc.) are some of the heaviest users of social media. People prefer to associate with others like them (homophily); this often shuts minorities out.

Old people are alone a lot. Call your grandma. - Average 70-year-old: 185 days a year with no interaction with a close friend.

Sparse networks of friends vs. dense networks Sparse: better ideas (less groupthink), correlated with income/promotion/success in men. NOT correlated with career success in women (usually need a dense network with a strategic partner/mentor). Dense: friends take better care of you.

Great predictor of success in long-term romantic relationships: degree of integration of your social network with your spouse. (Comment: Maybe just increases the "cost" of divorce, keeps marriages together longer than they should last...).

Biggest unmet social needs: - Close relationships, esp with family (you can't pick your relatives) ==> Facebook is NOT designed for 70-year-olds. - Distance - Un-intrusive, easy-to-use technology
