"There's something about men and power, and it just connects with all the other body parts..."

How promising executives in large firms get derailed: (1) Difficulty building an effective team (usually, over-manage/under-delegate) (2) Difficulty in making transitions (get stuck in the details, don't learn to think strategically) (3) Lack of follow-through (unkept promises) (4) Treat people badly (seen as over-ambitious or self-centered) (5) Over-dependent on a single strength or resource (become "the budgeting guy" or something) (6) Strategic differences with top management ("lose" political fights, etc.)
