mixi: Our first case on a "friend" platform. A wildly successful Japanese blogging platform.

Network: - Much smaller than Facebook: avg = 27 friends => only add "strong friends;" exclude boss and ex - Fictitious names, fake photos - Still friends with strangers...

Write: - Lengthy diary entries: one paragraph or more, lots of comments - Expectation of privacy: see "footprints" - High impact/meaning to friends

Read: - Leaves footprints (imagine if you could see who viewed your Facebook profile): prevents stalking - Strangers can read...

Still "meet" elements even though it's a "friend" product...

Who uses this? Narrow set of users, small proportion of Japanese population (18-27) => LOW virality Typical of friend platforms: you don't invite everyone you know.

What is the appeal in Japan? More normative bounds on behavior = more social failures Hard to meet people, in-person friend interactions highly structured

On monetization: Monetization is much easier on "meet" platforms than "friend" platforms. You can just charge -- it's really hard to meet new people. Friend platforms must monetize indirectly: large user bases, depend on virality and/or high engagement.

On engagement (data from a several "friend" platforms): - Fully 70% of activity is stalking (reading about others). - Read is always controllable! Add footprints (or something like it). - Why is Facebook really appealing? Because it is really hard to be nosy in real life. But easy on FB!
