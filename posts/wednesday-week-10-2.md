Business model decision: IP Licensing vs. OEM => "right" answer is probably a mix\
IP Licensing: Less capital intensive/higher margin but more exposed to copying by competitors with deep pockets to fight legal battles. AND the cost of litigation rises with success; truly high-potential innovations inspire more knock-offs.\
OEM: Worse margins, more protection of IP, may be harder to push technology to market (need partnerships; difficult to establish).

Criteria for deciding who to partner with/which markets to enter:\
-- High pain = high willingness to pay/suitability of innovation\
-- Non-exclusivity\
-- Internal R&D capability of partner = tradeoff between driving faster adoption/crossing the chasm vs. partner's ability to innovate around you/cut OEMs out.
