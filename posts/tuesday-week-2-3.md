Why doesn't Volvo do every activity in Sweden?\
Competitive and comparative advantage.

Why does Volvo start out in Sweden?\
Seems strange; dinky little country produces ~20% of heavy trucks in the world...\
Actually:\
Context for firm strategy and rivalry >> Scania\
Demand conditions >> Icy roads, fuel efficiency, safety, cost of shipping\
Factor [input] conditions >> talented people/engineers, raw materials (steel)\
Related/supporting industries >> high standards in cars, steel mills
