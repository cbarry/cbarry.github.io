There are omnipresent incentive problems that seem to come up in any agreement. But it's still worth thinking about how to minimize incentive problems. Good example: Sergey Bubka (Olympian pole vaulter) had an endorsement contract that promised him a new Mercedes-Benz automobile each time he broke the world record for the pole vault. Sergey Bubka broke the world record for the pole vault 21 consecutive times during his 20-year career, each time by a centimeter. Was this what Daimler-Benz had in mind?

There are a myriad set of ways that investors (VC or PE funds) capture pieces of the pie that they would not appear to merit.

Deal terms have a price. It is worth considering what that price is. "If the seller set the price and I could negotiate the terms, we could always come to a deal. So the owner got his $2mn. He just got it a different way, over a different period of time." - Jim Sharpe
