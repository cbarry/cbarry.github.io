[Frederic Tudor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Tudor) was the man.

\- Cutting ice in Boston and shipping it to the West Indies: sounds totally ridiculous, but ice in Martinique sells for 40-80x price of ice in Boston. - Thrown in debtors prison twice; still manages to build a large and (semi) respectable business => tolerance for failure/lack of stigma to bankruptcy = incredibly important - Knowledge/experience/tech progress in a sleepy industry = roots of magnificent success

Photos of "Ice Diary" (Frederic Tudor's personal journal), an almanac, and the ledgers of Tudor Ice Company. It's a good thing that I was born in the late 20th century and not the early 19th; my handwriting is far too messy to make a go of it as a old-school corporate tycoon.
