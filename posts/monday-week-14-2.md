-- Context for early-stage companies is different\
=> Typically not the same "runway" for employees to improve as large firms\
=> Typically a lot more firings

-- Two types of firing: performance-related vs. direction/fit-related\
-- Neither should come as a surprise. Do quarterly reviews, other good management practices.

FIRING SOMEONE\
Where: Conference room, no interior windows\
When: Early in the week, late in the day\
Who: Manager plus one other "company voice" (HR, COO, CFO, etc.)\
What: All paperwork ready in advance; have answers to any conceivable question\
How: Get straight to the point.\
-- Don't get involved in deep conversation or debate.\
-- Stick to observables, not impressions.\
-- Do make confirming remarks about former employee's character if relevant ("appreciate your hard work," "value your dedication," etc.)\
-- Emphasize finality.

Other thoughts:\
-- Threat of termination is a slippery slope.\
-- Don't drag it out.\
-- Think about what you want out of the former employee, post-departure. It's probably not "nothing."\
-- Don't tell other employees that someone their co-worker was fired; tell them his/her last day was XXX (maybe exceptions for felony). "Circumstances surrounding his/her departure were personal and confidential" or something.\
Would you want other people to know that you were fired, or what you were fired for? No.
