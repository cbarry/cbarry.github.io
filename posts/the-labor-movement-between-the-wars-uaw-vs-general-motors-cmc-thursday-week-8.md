A testament to the current state of labor relations in America: the NYC public schoolday ends at 2:57 and 30 seconds. Compromise is a strange beast.

Trends in labor in the 1920s:\
-- Welfare capitalism (cooperative company unions)\
===> "share the wealth" ... but not sharing much of the power, claims of injustice

-- AF of L\
===> militant to "necessary auxiliary" to schism/CIO

-- CIO (and expansion across multiple industries)\
===>Â [John L. Lewis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L._Lewis): fosters disconnect between workers and managers OR creates value?\
===> pivotal role in building the system

-- Role of government\
===> regulatory powers, generally sympathetic to unions (Wagner Act: firms must accept collective bargaining)

Increasing separation between managers and works\
===> ethnic tensions\
===> shift from workers as skilled craftsman to workers as interchangeable cogs

UAW vs. GM\
UAW: Big demand = sole bargaining. Also: more union rights, seniority protection, no unjust dismissals, decrease working hours, minimum pay.\
GM: No to everything; labor should stay out of management prerogatives.

Aftermath of the strike in Flint, Mich. (1937)\
=> Apex of U.S. auto industry = 1955 (almost two decades later)\
=> Still riding high in 1975\
=> Japanese competitors pull ahead in 1985 and never really look back.\
And we still have a massive auto industry to bail out in 2008.

Sloan might blame the unions: capital should've been allocated away from dying industries long before. No easy answers...
