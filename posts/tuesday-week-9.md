Why focus on "rich vs. king" (1) Preponderance => issues seem to arise frequently. (2) Inherent conflict => obvious tradeoffs between control and value creation; more of a clear-cut tradeoff than most founding challenges.

The paradox of success as an entrepreneur/why "rich vs. king" is a challenge. [![](images/Slide1-300x225.jpg "Paradox of entrepreneurial success")](../../img/Slide1.jpg)

Co-Founding: What's the "right" team? Rich co-founder + rich co-founder => no conflict King co-founder + rich co-founder => disagree about decision-making; fight about which rich vs. king fork to take (relinquish board control? hire experienced managers? give out equity to attract good early employees?) King co-founder + king co-founder => two sets of hands on the steering wheel... but, aligned values.
