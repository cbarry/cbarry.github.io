Why do people play games in the real world?\
-- Escape reality, kill time\
-- Develop mastery, pursue achievements\
-- Competition => with friends!\
-- Structure interaction with friends => both acquaintances (get to know people better) and close friends (excuse to spend time together)\
Problems: maybe hard, maybe boring, losing is no fun, scheduling challenges

Zynga uses of Facebook Platform:\
==> Pro-social engineering\
-- Go and help your friends harvest some eggplant! => cooperative, building together\
-- Friends will drive game selection => play with your buddies\
==> Anti-social engineering\
-- Constant barrage of FarmVille posts => game may cost you a friendship

The business consequences:\
1\. Free customer acquisition via newsfeed and direct message (awkward?)\
2\. Heightened retention: "Come and help me out!" => aided by game elements: the games are easy and simplistic and bad.

A great social strategy: eBay Group Buying\
1\. User X opts-in\
2\. User X picks a gift for User Y\
3\. eBay posts group buying message on User X's profile: visible to mutual friends of X and Y; invisible to Y\
Business outcome: avg successful gift has 4.2 participants, sells for 5x avg eBay sale price => people spend more money if they're spending it with their friends (solves social failures)\
Side benefits: participants return to eBay site 4x on average, one-third of participants open a new PayPal account.\
With zero marginal cost to eBay!
