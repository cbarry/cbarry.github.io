Decomposing ROE:\
[![](../../img/roe-300x79.jpg "roe")](../../img/roe.jpg)

Home Depot current performance (2000) versus past:\
-- More stores (scale/efficiency gains), higher revenue per square foot, higher revenue per transaction (customer loyalty?)\
-- Higher NOPAT margins, but lower asset turnover => shift from leasing stores to ownership; "clustering" strategy in store expansion\
-- Favorable macro environment

Growth plans:\
-- "Design" stores => higher margin BUT lower turnover? more sensitive to business cycle? saturated market?\
-- International geographic expansion => higher cost?\
-- Internet/in-store pickup => lower COGS BUT less customer service (Home Depot value proposition)\
-- Expansion to professionals and Buy-It-Yourself => huge markets, big transactions BUT more cyclical?

Key questions (hard to answer):\
What is terminal sales growth?\
What is correct market risk premium (in hindsight; this was mid-2000)?\
What will long-term NOPAT margins be?
