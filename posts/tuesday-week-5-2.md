Interesting to think about comparison with Rent the Runway. Both e-commerce, but many differences.

Differences/unique Chegg attributes:\
-- Seasonality => Chegg makes all its money from 2 three-week periods every year (academic calendar)\
-- Digital future => Print textbooks are probably not going to be around forever; (slowly) evaporating core business.\
-- Chegg CVP = saving money on textbooks; RTR CVP = "Cinderella moments"\
-- Customers have a finite lifespan (undergrads = four years of books) => LTV is limited\
-- Customers are REQUIRED to have textbooks (RTR = emotional choice)

Commonality between Chegg and RTR:\
-- Teaching new customer behaviors is challenging. Need to articulate process very clearly...\
-- Homogenous user base = easy chasm\
-- Disruption! (Colin: maybe...)

Capital-intensive startups are hard to manage. End up with a gazillion investors, often many different kinds of investors (angels, VCs, growth equity, etc.) with varied preferences, appetite for risk, etc.
