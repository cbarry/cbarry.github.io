Financial analysis challenge: separate operating effects from financing effects.\
Also, I never want to be an equity research analyst (even though this class is actually pretty interesting)

FedEx => All operating leases, reduces net income a little but dramatically understates size of total asset base ($8B in "hidden" assets). On the other hand, impact on ROE is minimal.\
Why capital leases make sense: conservative/accurate approach to leverage and firm's ability to take on debt.

One-time events sometimes swamp "real" performance\
-- UPS strike kills profitability in one FY\
-- FedEx acquisition of RPS dramatically changes cost structure in another FY

Condensing the income statement: four key metrics\
-- Sales\
-- Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT) = Net Income + Net Interest Expense (after taxes)\
==> Earnings on Net Operating Assets; driven by sales growth\
-- Net Interest Expense After Taxes = (Interest Expense -- Interest Income) x (1 -- Tax Rate)\
==> After-tax cost of Net Debt; driven by leverage and financing costs\
-- Net Income\
======> Separates operating net income from effects of capital structure

Condensing the balance sheet: four key components\
Total Net Operating Assets\
(1) Net Working Capital => minimal economies of scale\
(2) Net Long-Term Assets => potential economies of scale

Total Capital (financing)\
(3) Net Debt (interest bearing) => drives interest expense\
(4) Equity => residual claim on earnings
