How to think about intellectual property: [![](images/patents-300x100.jpg "patents")](http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/patents.jpg)

Goodyear and vulcanized rubber: high net benefit to society (rubber was a $1B industry by 1918), low private returns

U.S. Patent Law: - Underlying principles are bit strange and undemocratic => granting a monopoly on an idea? - Filing is really cheap (1/10 of the cost to file in the UK in the 19th century) - "First to invent" not "first to file," extensions allowed => encourages lone-inventor (like Goodyear) - Set up to protect inventors from exploitation and encourage innovation in a young country. - US (developing) vs. UK (developed) conflicts over IP => startlingly similar to US vs. China now.

Constant tension/problem: profits from innovation accrue to agents/intermediaries rather than to the inventor
