How the heck can Facebook monetize?

Display Ads -- mediocre results Why ads don't work well on social platforms: - Wrong context (salesman pulls up a chair at your family dinner table) - Harms user experience - No purchasing intent (vs. search engine, which have >2% CTR)

Targeted ads (age/geography/education/gender/religion/interests) -- somewhat better results

Friend-approved, brand-generated content -- great The real goldmine: the "Like" button ===> Friend-posted ads = 10x higher CTR. Why? surprise, relevance, FEAR OF MISSING OUT And your friend endorsed it -- doesn't look like advertising! But why do people tolerate -- and even welcome -- app-generated content? ===> People want content. And people hate writing -- ~25% of active Facebook users have blank profiles.

Brand pages -- mixed bag As a one-way channel to communicate with fans -- maybe good ===> Cheap way to talk to users and share content, BUT preaching to the converted (users already opted in) Upside: shareable stories; maybe good content goes viral and builds awareness with friends As a channel for fans to communicate with brand and with each other -- not so great Upside: feedback on customer experience Downside: probably not good feedback (people tend to post complaints), brands forfeit control over their image (can't really moderate/curate your brand page; it's creepy)

Facebook Platform (access to everything but users' "read" history; capability to post to profile) -- jackpot Examples: FarmVille posts to my profile when I play, horoscope app posts to my profile every day with zero input from me, EventBrite posts ticket purchases on my profile. EventBrite: I buy a Lady Gaga ticket. EventBrite posts to my profile -- free advertising for Lady Gaga, social proof of event's awesomeness! Very high CTR! My friend buys a ticket, and the cycle repeats itself. Is there really any better advertising than "your friend bought this"? EventBrite says the average write-back is worth $2.50 !!!

Takeaways: the best social strategies solve users' social failures. People hate generating content. Do it for them...
