"History rhymes; it doesn't repeat itself." - Mark Twain

Echoes of Jefferson/Madison (fairness/equity) vs. Hamilton (prosperity) debate resonate in TARP.

Hamilton's Plan: (1) Consolidation of state debts (Delaware = $50K, Mass = $5M => fair?) (2) Repay current debt holders (rewards speculators who bought debt, ignores originators \[war vets\] who supported revolution; BUT establishes property rights precedent) (3) Taxation by central government (4) Central bank (Bank of US)

Madison's Plan: Moral victory; fair to citizens who gave the most during revolutionary war. BUT long-term implications for future investors if government can intervene in market.
