Non-profit founding => many of the same control vs. impact tradeoffs as for-profit ventures.

How disciplined/accountable/metric-driven can you make a non-profit? How useful is it?\
Factors that might enable a tilt towards king => non-fiduciary boards, investors/donors have fewer forcing mechanisms to influence management, non-monetary results complicate objective assessment of impact.

Earl: Many classmates who said they would join the corporate world to gain relevant experience and then move into non-profit sector to make an impact.\
"Nine out of 10 people never make it back."\
If you want to be involved in non-profit organizations/social justice causes, be careful about postponing participation.
