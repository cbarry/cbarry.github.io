    <p>I am a product manager focused on storefront ecommerce at <a href="https://www.wayfair.com">Wayfair</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, I worked on user acquisition and engagement at <a href="http://www.localytics.com/">Localytics</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, I worked at <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/">athenahealth</a>.</p>
<p>I graduated from <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/">Harvard Business School</a> in May 2012. I focused my coursework and time/energy on technology entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>I worked on Peddl -- the easiest way to buy and sell things from the people around you. We were a finalist in the MIT $100K Business Plan Contest in 2012, and we won the mobile track.</p>
<p>I was also a co-founder at Meater, a mobile biotech platform to detect illness in beef cattle. We were <a href="http://mit100k.org/accelerate/semi-finalists/meater/">finalists in MIT $100K ACCELERATE</a> in 2011. I still think that data and analytics will change how agribusiness works.</p>
<p>I spent the summer between my first and second years of graduate school at <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com">athenahealth</a> doing process innovation (product management) for <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/practice/athenaclinicals">athenaClinicals</a>, a cloud-based electronic health record app.</p>
<p>In my first year of business school, I took a class called <a href="http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/elab-student-information">Entrepreneurship Lab</a> at the <a href="http://mitsloan.mit.edu/">MIT Sloan School</a> that gave me the opportunity to work with <a href="http://www.qdvision.com/">QD Vision</a>, a nanomaterials startup.</p>
<p>Before that, I was an infantry officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. I was in <a href="http://www.mcbh.usmc.mil/3mar/2dbn/2-3%20INDEX.htm">2d Battalion, 3d Marines</a> in Kaneohe Bay, HI. My battalion deployed to Karmah, Iraq, and southern Afghanistan. When I lived in Hawaii, I enjoyed scuba diving and trail running. I left active duty in August 2010 and began my MBA two weeks later.</p>
<p>Before that, I went to <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth College</a>. I majored in economics and philosophy. I was the president of <a href="http://www.thedartmouth.com">The Dartmouth</a>, a daily newspaper that is the oldest college paper in America. <a href="http://www.thedartmouth.com">The Dartmouth</a> is NOT the same thing as the Dartmouth Review.</p>
<p>I wrote code for the <a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/">U.S. Navy</a> (probabilistic neural networks!) and <a href="http://www.cgi.com/en/home">CGI</a> (back when it was AMS), and I started a catchily-named web development shop with a friend. I went to high school at <a href="http://www.stalbansschool.org/">St. Albans School</a> in Washington, DC.</p>
