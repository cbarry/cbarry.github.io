		<title>Buying health insurance, Part II -- The single guy</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/buying-health-insurance-part-i/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am a single man in my late 20s. I run marathons for fun, I don&#39;t have any chronic diseases, and I am financially stable. And I avoid unnecessary doctor-visits at all costs. This is starting to sound like an eHarmony dating profile...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I expect to consume almost no healthcare next year, and I am insuring against the unlikely possibility that I contract a serious and expensive disease like cancer. All things being equal, I would prefer a PPO --- in the unlikely event that I get leukemia, I&#39;d rather go to the oncologist I want instead of the oncologist who is cheapest for my insurer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my healthcare needs are relatively easy to model.&lt;br /&gt;
I pay a premium out every paycheck. If I consume healthcare, I will probably pay --- depending on which plan I choose, I&#39;ll pay the first $500 or so of my medical costs, after which my insurer will pay most or all of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most basic choice is a simple HMO vs. a simple PPO.&lt;br /&gt;
There are some differences in emergency room and prescription drug benefits between these two choices, but they appear relatively immaterial.&lt;br /&gt;
We can model how much I would pay under each plan in a variety of states of the world:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/singleguy1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/singleguy1-1024x591.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;singleguy1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to read this: If my healthcare in 2012 costs the amount on the x-axis, I will pay the amount on the y-axis. So if I consume $600 worth of healthcare, I&#39;ll pay about $1,800 with an HMO and $3,800 with a PPO (both in-network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major discovery: I will pay about $2,000 per year for the option of out-of-network coverage.&lt;br /&gt;
Worth it? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot thickens when we consider the more complicated PPO plan, which includes a Health Savings Account.&lt;br /&gt;
The quick and dirty version: if I agree to pay for more of my healthcare upfront ($1500 deductible versus $500), I get a savings account that I can only spend on healthcare.&lt;br /&gt;
My employer will contribute $375 per year to this account, and I can put in up to $3,100 every year, tax free. It works a lot like retirement account (investment options, early withdrawal penalties, etc. etc.). And in return for accepting more risk that I will have to foot the bill for minor healthcare stuff myself, I pay dramatically lower premiums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employer-contribution angle looks interesting --- my employer subsidizes my healthcare spending to the tune of $375.&lt;br /&gt;
The tax-free part looks more interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
I am fortunate enough to pay a relatively high marginal tax rate (33%), so the prospect of shielding some of my income from taxes is attractive. If you know of another way to get a 33% riskless return in a year, please drop me an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax-shield makes an HSA slightly complicated to analyze. I can afford to save at least $3K per year and I am fairly sure I will spend down my HSA at some point in the future when I have real healthcare expenses. So I will ignore the various constraints on using an HSA, and only examine the tax implications of contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more complex PPA+HSA plan turns out to be better than a plain-jane PPO in every case (strongly Paredo-optimal, if you are as big a stats nerd as me). It&#39;s also cheaper than an HMO if I consume minimal healthcare next year:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/singleguy2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/singleguy2-1024x591.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;singleguy2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If I am willing to save the maximum ($3,100 per year), the complicated PPO is cheaper than an HMO in any scenario. Even if I spend a bundle on healthcare, I can still save $500 over managed care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the plan that offer the best care (PPO + HSA) is actually substantially cheaper for me.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Buying health insurance (or, How I Stopped Worrying and Love Consumer-Driven Health Care)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/buying-health-insurance-or-how-i-stopped-worrying-love-consumer-driven-health-care/"/>
		<updated>2012-06-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/buying-health-insurance-or-how-i-stopped-worrying-love-consumer-driven-health-care/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, I returned to the working world after a two-year hiatus (vacation?) at the Harvard Business School.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the myriad shocks of resuming full-time employment was that I now have to PAY for medical care. Ridiculous, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fortunate enough to work at a fabulous, progressive healthcare software firm that offers its employees a choice of health insurance plans administered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, my state&#39;s largest insurer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m afforded the opportunity to choose between three plans --- an HMO (they pick the doctors), a PPO (basically, pays 80% when you visit out-of-network doctors), and a more gnarly PPO with provisions for a Health Savings Account --- a sort of 401(K) plan for healthcare expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cue &amp;quot;the paradox of choice&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On my first day of work, a plethora of paper slips and brochures and supplemental booklets (really --- dead trees!) explained the benefits afforded under each plan.&lt;br /&gt;
There were lots of tables and footnotes and appendices.&lt;br /&gt;
I had no idea which plan to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, you ask: how is this possible?&lt;br /&gt;
Colin, you worry about healthcare for a living! (actually, healthcare information technology --- but whatever)&lt;br /&gt;
How can you be totally bewildered by something as simple as how to insure yourself?&lt;br /&gt;
I wondered this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got over my initial feelings of shame, I started thinking about my bank account.&lt;br /&gt;
In most matters I am a ridiculous cheapskate --- so I decided I should probably understand what I was buying.&lt;br /&gt;
And because I am an MBA, &amp;quot;understand what I was buying&amp;quot; usually means a bunch of spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel.&lt;br /&gt;
So without further ado, a several-part analysis of my health insurance options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My options appear (based on some cursory and admittedly quick research) to be relatively typical of people employed by mid-sized companies in New England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A caveat: I know a little something about exchanging clinical healthcare data. I am far from an expert in the insurance side of healthcare. I am not licensed to dispense advice about insurance decision-making. I have no particular desire to become a credible advisor on individual health insurance.&lt;br /&gt;
So take my analysis with many grains of salt. If you buy healthcare based on a blog post, you&#39;re completely insane. Think about your particular situation yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An HMO-style plan typically offers low premiums and a low deductible ($500), and assigns the patient to a primary-care physician. HMOs make it extremely expensive to visit out-of-network doctors --- generally, you&#39;ll pay out of pocket --- and attempt to deter emergency room visits in all but the most dire of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a PPO-style plan offers higher premiums and higher deductibles, but enable the patient more choice in picking doctors. The payer reimburses visits to out-of-network physicians at some pre-determined rate --- if you pick your own orthopedic surgeon, you&#39;ll pay 20% of the cost and the insurance company will pay 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively, PPO insurance is buying an option --- if you have some complex medical problem and you want treatment from the best doctor in your area, the insurance company will still pick up most of the tab.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, PPOs generally involve less &amp;quot;hassle&amp;quot; --- if you fall down the stairs and you know you broke your leg, you can go straight to an orthopedic surgeon without first visiting a primary-care doc to confirm that, yes, your leg is actually broken.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What is cool and different about Nike?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Online social networking intended to drive real, physical, offline behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
-- They built an entirely new hardware product category around social stuff. Real commitment to non-traditional marketing, consistent branding, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike+&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; One of the few (so far) social networks where participation requires you to buy a physical good.&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Friend elements: share to Facebook (Motivation!), run with your friends --- virtually, games, compare workouts with friends/compete&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Meet elements: Grid/community of runners (stop by a Nike store at 7am sometime...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically, digital strategy is not a totally separate thing from social strategy for most firms. And they do some really cool digital stuff too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Write the Future&amp;quot;/Football (soccer) contests: make a page about how great you are at soccer and get people to vote for you&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Nike gets tens of thousands of people to upload videos of themselves playing soccer. Video is absolutely the hardest &amp;quot;write&amp;quot; to elicit --- how many times have you posted to YouTube?&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Nike somehow convinces 100K people to make brand-oriented Facebook fan pages. How is this possible? How much would you have to pay to get 100K people to make individual fan sites for your brand? Or, you could just run a contest...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The first 500 fans were a lot harder to get than the next 500,000.&amp;quot; -- Blair Fowler, YouTube celebrity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Blair Fowler and her sister become YouTube beauty fashionistas from their bedroom in Tennessee?&lt;br /&gt;
Blair: first-mover advantage.&lt;br /&gt;
In summer 2008, there were only four people putting beauty tutorials on YouTube. Last year, there were about 100,000 people on YouTube with four or more beauty videos.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We could&#39;ve been blogging about paper airplanes and there would&#39;ve been people watching.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
[Maybe, I think she&#39;s ridiculously savvy]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is Blair successful?&lt;br /&gt;
Her content is &amp;quot;not just straight make-up videos --- people feel like I&#39;m letting them into my life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips on acquiring a massive followership:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Related your content to Twitter trending topics; post to Twitter under a trending hashtag&lt;br /&gt;
-- Figure out how to get people to send viral e-mails linking to your content. Run contests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much work does she actually do?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;One [ten-minute] video takes me one day, like from morning until night.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I try to do one per two days.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah, she works pretty hard, too...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My very last class at HBS.&lt;br /&gt;
Honored to have as incredible instructors as Tom Eisenmann and Jeff Bussgang...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaways from listening to two really smart FIELD teams present:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Balsamiq is a pretty excellent tool for wireframing.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Good technique: do some customer interviews, make wireframes of five possible features. Then ask people to allocate 100 &amp;quot;points&amp;quot; among the five features. Figure out what people really want (because they want everything, but they probably don&#39;t want everything equally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy interface that integrates several different types/sources of data in a fairly superficial way is often a very valuable thing. -- Jeff Bussgang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- One channel to consider/CAC to measure: in-person sales. Send a guy with an iPad to the customer; show the customer a mockup; ask for an e-mail address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&#39;s very inexpensive to build a brand as a first-mover. It&#39;s very expensive to build a brand as a second-mover.&amp;quot; -- Jeff Bussgang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/11-108.pdf&quot;&gt;With a Little Help from my (Random) Friends: Success and Failure in Post-Business School Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;, Lerner and Malmendier (2007):&lt;br /&gt;
Only 13 percent of HBS startups (&#39;97-&#39;04) succeed by any measure. And the number of real &amp;quot;successes&amp;quot; is a lot lower.&lt;br /&gt;
But most founders end up in interesting places regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Entrepreneurship is a career path. What you&#39;re doing right now is what you&#39;ll be doing in 10 years.&amp;quot; -- HBS Alum, Class of 1999&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Arguably I am not a bouncing-off-the-walls kind of guy. But today, even less so.&amp;quot; -- Francois Brochet, on being ill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaways from a semester of accounting-based valuation:&lt;br /&gt;
-- It&#39;s useful to approach financial statement analysis in a systematic sort of way. Overview, business model, accounting analysis, financial analysis, valuation.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Business analysis informs financial analysis; differentiate between financial and non-financial metrics. It&#39;s hard to analyze a company if you have no clue how they actually make money.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Compare accounting policies across peer companies; investigate differences.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Read footnotes, always.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Identify assumptions, construct scenarios, do sensitivity analysis. Otherwise, you don&#39;t know what&#39;s actually an important assumption...&lt;br /&gt;
-- Markets make mistakes. Just objectives; it happens.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Just because it&#39;s good and correct and legal accounting doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t change it to do valuation. Example: Company X goes from owning 49% of a subsidiary to 51%. It consolidates the subsidiaries results on its financial statements and revenue increases by 40% between one year and the next. Good accounting? Yes, that&#39;s how GAAP works. Useful for valuation purposes/analyzing operating performance? No way.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Ghana at Independence (MOC, Tuesday, Week 13)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/ghana-moc-tuesday-week-13/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/ghana-moc-tuesday-week-13/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ghana gains independence in 1957. It has a lot going for it.&lt;br /&gt;
Endowments: abundant natural resources, favorable geography.&lt;br /&gt;
Macro: solid healthcare, good education system, stable/prudent macro policy, low debt, good political institutions&lt;br /&gt;
Firms: Lots of MNCs, healthy proto-clusters&lt;br /&gt;
Micro: good roads, English-speaking, sound banking system, open to trade/FDI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it goes off a cliff. What went wrong?&lt;br /&gt;
Strategy: &amp;quot;African socialism,&amp;quot; populist bent&lt;br /&gt;
Macro: inefficient gov&#39;t spending, becomes tied to a few commodities&lt;br /&gt;
Political: huge government employment, &amp;quot;President for Life,&amp;quot; instability/corruption&lt;br /&gt;
Micro: massive and inefficient SOEs, infrastructure spend on trophy projects, price controls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did this happen? Lots of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Unearned&amp;quot; income funds bad policies that don&#39;t work. Confluence of aid donation, remittances, and natural resource wealth lets Ghana keep struggling along with terrible development policy long past the point when people should demand a change.&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Colonial legacy? Backlash to colonial legacy (let&#39;s do everything different)? Unlikely; British were not especially oppressive, and they left Ghana on fairly decent terms.&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Bad neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Politics/welfare populism.&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; BAD IDEAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kufuor elected in 2000; eight years of progress. Leaves office after two terms; successor starts turning back the clock.&lt;br /&gt;
Challenges: How hard to push for change? How fast? Where do you start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, in 2007, something new in Ghana:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&#39;s the worst thing that could ever happen?&amp;quot; -- Michael Porter&lt;br /&gt;
They discover oil! Three billion barrels of it!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Social Strategy at the Harvard Business Review (CSN, Tuesday, Week 13)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/social-strategy-at-the-harvard-business-review-csn-tuesday-week-12/"/>

		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/social-strategy-at-the-harvard-business-review-csn-tuesday-week-12/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;HBR business model:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Capitalize on Harvard brand!&lt;br /&gt;
-- Top-notch contributors&lt;br /&gt;
-- Long articles, not just tidbits&lt;br /&gt;
So: higher price than competitors, lower circulation (vs. Economist, FT, Fortune).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why go online?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Cheaper lead generation (vs. offline)&lt;br /&gt;
-- More current content (vs. offline), additional revenue (freemium)?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Searchability (past issues)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Content testing (try out covers before they get printed)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Let readers meet each other??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big takeaways:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Firms have an initial tendency to think of social media as a one-way dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Meet&amp;quot; is always easier to monetize than &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; --- usually have to find indirect ways to profit from friend platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HBR&#39;s reflections on key factors for success:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Experimentation: Easy to talk about having a culture of experimentation; really hard to actually do it.&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Success Metrics: Without some concrete performance criteria, it&#39;s hard to know how well things are working.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Know When to Pull the Plug: It&#39;s really hard to declare that a project has failed, but it&#39;s important to end experiments that don&#39;t work. Otherwise, you can&#39;t experiment...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does Amex do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Card issue:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Aspirational/premium image (fees), higher spending per cardholder than competitors&lt;br /&gt;
-- Direct to consumer (no issuers) = CONTROL, &amp;quot;closed loop&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
but CAC is higher than competitors ($250+)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transaction processing:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Charge higher fees to merchants&lt;br /&gt;
-- First-mover into value-add services: travel planning, concierge =&amp;gt; consumer perception of safety&lt;br /&gt;
but limited availability of merchants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding liabilities:&lt;br /&gt;
-- 8% loss provisions (disputed charges; non-payment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then they start getting into social...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/amex2x2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/amex2x2-1024x765.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;amex2x2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengths of AmEx execution:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Willingness to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Evolve from mediocre initiatives (Members Project) to stuff that drives business results (Social Rewards Program). Develops in-house social proficiency; solves the &amp;quot;Legal needs three days to review every tweet&amp;quot; problems; continuous improvement.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Because CAC is ordinarily so high, lots of potential in social/network effects pay off handsomely.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Capitalizes on existing AmEx positioning/overall strategy (trustworthiness of brand means that consumers are more likely to link credit card to FourSquare account; premium image means that consumers are more likely to brag about AmEx deals/share with friends).&lt;br /&gt;
-- Ends up with AmEx thinking about their core business differently (potential to drive traffic to retailers; loosely competitive with Groupon/LivingSocial).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Still a big company.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Change takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Usually, everybody&#39;s social strategy starts with taking your initial product and sprinkling in badly-designed social elements (make a Facebook page). Need to evolve from there.&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Usually, there is some element of trade-off between fixing social failures and effectively monetizing. It&#39;s hard to find programs that (1) make a boatload of money and (2) offer awesome social solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>De Beers // Creating Shared Value vs. Corporate Social Responsibility (MOC, Monday, Week 13)</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What is a company&#39;s responsibility to the country/region/town it operates in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Corporate Social Responsibility&amp;quot; = sharing the value a firm captures by arbitrarily choosing little charity projects to pay for (reeks of firms distracting the public from the profits they make/CYA).&lt;br /&gt;
Example: Ronald McDonald House --- taking care of kids with cancer is admirable, but has nothing to do with McDonald&#39;s business model.&lt;br /&gt;
[vs]&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Creating Shared Value&amp;quot; = projects in line with firm&#39;s business strategy that grow the pie/benefit the firm by improving the broader community.&lt;br /&gt;
Examples: Microsoft supports community college IT programs with free job training, software, and class guests --- good for the world, and creates customers and potential employees for MSFT. Nestle works with farmers in developing nations to improve yields and build infrastructure/healthcare/schools --- admirable projects that also improve the quality and reliability of Nestle&#39;s supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, society does not expect successful firms to donate money to random social causes --- government is supposed to allocate resources to fix social problems with firms&#39; tax dollars.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, the world increasingly seems to demand arbitrary corporate charity...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does De Beers create value? They sell tiny, (relatively) plentiful stones that have minimal functional use.&lt;br /&gt;
Industrial diamonds are worth &amp;lt;$1 per carat... [Putting aside all my qualms about whether De Beers creates much real value at all...] ==&amp;gt; Supply/mining&lt;br /&gt;
Exploration and mining are not simple (and De Beers has innovated a lot); huge fixed costs; hard to run a business in countries where diamonds are plentiful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;==&amp;gt; Enable the market&lt;br /&gt;
Manage sightholders, fragmented retail (and benefits to retail branding), sorting technology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;==&amp;gt; Stimulate consumer demand&lt;br /&gt;
Advertising, positioning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask De Beers in private who actually adds value in the diamond business, they can make a pretty compelling case:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Without us, there would be nothing --- just a bunch of rocks.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
According to Jon Oppenheimer, it takes De Beers about 20 years to get to nominal breakeven on a new diamond discovery. This is not a quick-turnaround business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does De Beers do that benefits poor African countries?&lt;br /&gt;
Direct impact: taxes, jobs, infrastructure, purchases (&amp;quot;we buy stuff&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
Economic development: skill training, tourism development, cluster development, improves local business practices (maybe)&lt;br /&gt;
Political and social development: HIV/AIDS programs, environmental preserves, better housing, raise standards of government/suppliers, positive impact on political/legal processes (maybe), lends national legitimacy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dangers moving forward:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Declining market share =&amp;gt; harder for De Beers to maintain production discipline&lt;br /&gt;
-- Black Economic Empowerment (South Africa) =&amp;gt; imposes non-market constraints.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Beneficiation demands (Botswana: you must do cutting/sorting in our country, which has non-competitive factor conditions) =&amp;gt; If you think De Beers does any good for an African nation, it&#39;s in bringing innovation and efficient capitalism to places where that is rare. Why would you ever force them to do specific economic activities in your country that are NOT efficient? In general, as a country, why would you ever want firms to build non-competitive industries that rely on cheap labor? It can&#39;t work --- and you wouldn&#39;t even want it to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big issue: Politics. Dividing the pie/national governments&#39; desire to capture more $/create jobs (of any kind) in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2012-04-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/bessemer-trust-cmc-thursday-week-12/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Andrew Carnegie and Henry Phipps made some steel and got really rich. Carnegie built 3,000 libraries (and a lake for Princeton&#39;s crew team). Phipps started a trust to pay dividends to his descendants. Who did the most for America? (Carnegie, duh.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carnegie philosophy&lt;br /&gt;
Society benefits from wealth accumulation =&amp;gt; rich people have smarts and wherewithal to do &amp;quot;great things&amp;quot; for the community with lots of money. And they have a responsibility to do those things.&lt;br /&gt;
Rich people shouldn&#39;t live lavishly; some proportion should stay in family (maybe)&lt;br /&gt;
Pro-estate tax =&amp;gt; enforcement mechanism to ensure that the wealthy use their money for the betterment of the community. No &amp;quot;landed gentry.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
In sum: noblesse oblige (with more than a hint of rich-guy paternalism)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems:&lt;br /&gt;
Nice sentiment, hard to implement (hi Donald Trump) --- objectively, mega-rich people tend to buy more yachts than libraries&lt;br /&gt;
Ignores aspirational element of wealth accumulation (people get rich to pass on nice things to their children)&lt;br /&gt;
For whom should wealthy people do good? How should they allocate their wealth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phipps philosophy&lt;br /&gt;
Creates intricate trust; wealth for consumption and administration/investment --- in perpetuity.&lt;br /&gt;
Preaches moderation in consumption; behavioral guidelines for family&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stewards of capital;&amp;quot; creates professional wealth management organization&lt;br /&gt;
Bessemer Investment Company funds creation of dozens of firms; invests in the future of America; supports economic growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems:&lt;br /&gt;
Persistent income disparity; increasing concentration of capital&lt;br /&gt;
No mention of society --- don&#39;t rich people have an obligation to give back?&lt;br /&gt;
Arbitrary capture of massive asset-base by a single family --- is this &amp;quot;American?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Wikipedia Esperanza (CSN, Wednesday, Week 12)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/wikipedia-esperanza-csn-wednesday-week-12/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/wikipedia-esperanza-csn-wednesday-week-12/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Esperanza&quot;&gt;Wikipedia Esperanza&lt;/a&gt;: should Wikipedians keep it or shutter it? What kind of problems arise on User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep Esperanza&lt;br /&gt;
Premise: retention is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Quality of articles increases =&amp;gt; pressure on editors to perform&lt;br /&gt;
-- Helps retain editors and overcome negative stigmas (petty, flamewar-ridden community)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Stress alerts work =&amp;gt; Esperanza saved Bally!&lt;br /&gt;
-- Aids in conflict resolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ditch Esperanza&lt;br /&gt;
Premise: retention is not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Esperanza focuses editors on quantity, not quality =&amp;gt; keeps mediocre editors involved; they SHOULD leave&lt;br /&gt;
-- Coffee lounge is a distraction =&amp;gt; energy would be better put towards writing/editing&lt;br /&gt;
-- NOT transparent =&amp;gt; admin coaching; imposing artificial hierarchy&lt;br /&gt;
-- Stress alerts don&#39;t work&lt;br /&gt;
-- Engagement is NOT a problem =&amp;gt; new editors joining in droves (611K editors in &#39;06); attrition is minimal (90% of all editors are active); average number of edits is quite high (4.5 edits/mo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Wikipedia resolve conflicts? Open debate; democratic (maybe) process. But:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Violent fights/&amp;quot;revert wars&amp;quot; ==&amp;gt; settle disputes, but demotivating to &amp;quot;losers,&amp;quot; who may stop contributing =&amp;gt; BUT it feels good to correct people.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Is conflict resolution process really good? Most persistent editor wins; high schoolers with free time trump judgment of professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are Wikipedia editors?&lt;br /&gt;
Usually nerds, usually white, write about tech more than &amp;quot;culture.&amp;quot; Socially awkward?&lt;br /&gt;
Usually over-educated and underemployed.&lt;br /&gt;
Usually care about the topic (activists?).&lt;br /&gt;
Only 2% of editors are women, and half of them edit under a male-sounding name!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaway: There are &amp;quot;gendered&amp;quot; technologies! Wikipedia: built by boys, for boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big problem: correlation between write and read on Wikipedia = 0 (really. statistically.) Editors don&#39;t write more about the stuff that users actually look at.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/wiki.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/wiki.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;wiki&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If we want a good encyclopedia, we need to move stuff from &amp;quot;top left&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;top right&amp;quot; --- Wikipedia is really bad for finding out about certain subjects (painting, some kinds of history).&lt;br /&gt;
Compare to Yelp --- strong correlation between read/write, reviewers incentivized to produce content that actually gets read a lot (Elite status, compliments, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaway: There are huge read/write problems with UGC platforms --- because people typically write for themselves/other editors, NOT readers.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Yelp (CSN, Tuesday, Week 12)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/yelp-csn-monday-week-12/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/yelp-csn-monday-week-12/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yelp: an activity-based dating site masquerading as a portal for local business reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read elements: photos, variety of opinions, funny, accurate (?)&lt;br /&gt;
What does accurate mean? Good for 1s (surfacing terrible places), but lots of 3s and 4s. Self-selection among reviewers: fancy restaurants and greasy spoons get the same review.&lt;br /&gt;
Generally, common issues for user-generated content (UGC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write elements: Meet product! Yelp Elite community = great way to meet like-minded individuals.&lt;br /&gt;
Breadth: open to everyone, but must care about food and write well and have free time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search: lots of authentic, available data on individual Elites (hard to fake tone in hundreds of reviews), but hard to search and self-selection problems (you must write, too)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interaction: follow/compliment/forums AND parties! But still hard to interact on Yelp.&lt;br /&gt;
Takeaway: Yelp Elite = activity-based dating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare Yelp to TripAdvisor: What does social mean in business terms?&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Quality of reviews (positive reviews are more nuanced than on TripAdvisor)&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Retention of reviewers (they stay longer and they write more)&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Profiles are accurate, reviewers have personal credibility at stake&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Breadth of reviews: Elites are incentivized to cover new ground and broaden Yelp&#39;s base of reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how the heck do they monetize?&lt;br /&gt;
Charging small businesses is hard:&lt;br /&gt;
-- High-touch sales to low-dollar-value customers =&amp;gt; bad margins&lt;br /&gt;
-- Diminished incentive to advertise for highly-rated businesses: they already look great!&lt;br /&gt;
-- Diminished incentive to advertise for low-rated businesses: why drive traffic to a site that makes your restaurant look bad?&lt;br /&gt;
-- What does Yelp offer? Better positioning of positive reviews. Does anyone care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT lead generation is a powerful thing for small businesses.&lt;br /&gt;
Options: monetize data/analytics, build loyalty platform, serve as mediator between businesses and customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big takeaway: social strategy is NOT the same as digital strategy.&lt;br /&gt;
Digital strategy = How do I broadcast my message to people? (classic advertising)&lt;br /&gt;
Social strategy = How do I get people to meet/talk to each other, and then do things for my business?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>New Carolina Initiative (MOC, Tuesday, Week 12)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/new-carolina-initiative-moc-monday-week-12/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/new-carolina-initiative-moc-monday-week-12/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why has South Carolina stayed poor?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Agricultural history&lt;br /&gt;
-- Losing jobs in textiles and apparel&lt;br /&gt;
-- Bad educational/human capital base&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional South Carolina growth strategy:&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;pro-business&amp;quot; environment&lt;br /&gt;
-- cheap labor&lt;br /&gt;
-- recruit big manufacturing firms with tax incentives&lt;br /&gt;
-- emphasize technical education&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this doesn&#39;t work:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Subsidies are costly. State tax rate is significantly higher than national average (17.7% vs. 15%); tax incentives to big firms get paid for by local businesses/citizens.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Attract the wrong kind of firms: sensitive to labor costs = won&#39;t invest in human development&lt;br /&gt;
-- Doesn&#39;t address roads, schools, other fundamentals&lt;br /&gt;
-- There is always someone cheaper (globally)&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, focus on individual companies, not state competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did South Carolina do this?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Diversify away from dying industries&lt;br /&gt;
-- Jobs = politicians&#39; success metric&lt;br /&gt;
-- Tax incentives are not as visible to constituency as infrastructure spending&lt;br /&gt;
-- SHORT TERM VICTORIES = what politicians love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how well as the New Carolina Initiative performed?&lt;br /&gt;
Positives: some cluster organization, some state agency involvement, education/training metrics improved, foundation laid (?).&lt;br /&gt;
Negatives: still low per-capita income, still bad education, senior government leaders are uninvolved/skeptical, textiles are still bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;
Complicated by &#39;08 recession, and only really six or seven years old...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michael Milken: savior of American growth or common criminal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America in the 1970s/80s:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Deregulation, shift from manufacturing to service economy&lt;br /&gt;
-- Poorly-run large companies (maybe)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Future growth: small, riskier companies&lt;br /&gt;
-- Inflation drops in early &#39;80s&lt;br /&gt;
=== Trend: Replacement Cost &amp;gt; Market Value ===&lt;br /&gt;
-- Discount factor =&amp;gt; Stock market is undervalued? Complacent big companies? Suboptimal capital structures?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Focus on high agency costs =&amp;gt; Notion of &amp;quot;shareholder value&amp;quot; develops, backlash against managerial complacency. Decline of managerial capitalism??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, junk bonds:&lt;br /&gt;
Serve investor with higher risk appetite; betting on credit risk, not interest rates&lt;br /&gt;
Drexel takes the lead as market-maker&lt;br /&gt;
MILKEN =&amp;gt; foresight to realize that smaller firms need access to debt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds great. So what goes wrong?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/milken1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/milken1-1024x672.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;milken&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Milken maintain power?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Charisma, personal loyalty, cult of personality&lt;br /&gt;
-- He makes money for EVERYONE&lt;br /&gt;
-- Informational advantage&lt;br /&gt;
-- Due diligence capability, pricing&lt;br /&gt;
-- Network&lt;br /&gt;
-- Underwriting: Drexel buys full issue&lt;br /&gt;
-- ONE-MAN MARKET&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequences:&lt;br /&gt;
Presages rise of financial instruments.&lt;br /&gt;
Wave of MBOs and LBOs.&lt;br /&gt;
Decline of old-style managerial capitalism&lt;br /&gt;
Democratization of capital ... and then the savings and loan crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A German Jewish immigrant started a tiny grocery store in Montgomery, Alabama in 1844. Two of his brothers came over from Bavaria to join him. They called their business &amp;quot;Lehman Brothers.&amp;quot; Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;
Their business went broke in 2008 --- the largest bankruptcy in American history. What the heck happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sidenote: William Sharpe --- creator of CAPM and the Sharpe ratio --- reminds us that there are still other brothers: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv4HQG2Hz0I&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The wrong financial advisor&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle men: Outsiders with an appetite for risk and the capability to deal with it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do merchants become investment bankers?&lt;br /&gt;
Avenue to scale, industry/product-agnostic anyway, culture of apprenticeship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KFS for merchants: Competence, broad network, relationships, TRUST&lt;br /&gt;
Why so many German Jews? Historical precedent, international connections, and serious consequences to breaking trust (ostracism in small community)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evaluation of Lehman Brothers:&lt;br /&gt;
Merchants =&amp;gt; State bonds =&amp;gt; Stocks/bonds =&amp;gt; Investment funds =&amp;gt; International expansion =&amp;gt; Financial instruments&lt;br /&gt;
Consistent trends: filling a void, provisioning capital to growth industries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial industry changes too: Professionalization, greater scale, CONSOLIDATION (many benefits; spurs growth)&lt;br /&gt;
BUT: empire-building, declining competition, information asymmetry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do investment banks start off as partnerships?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Signal of commitment and diligence to customers =&amp;gt; partners have skin in the game&lt;br /&gt;
-- Solves agency issues =&amp;gt; no principal-agent problems&lt;br /&gt;
-- VALUE RESIDES IN HUMAN CAPITAL =&amp;gt; What the heck is the &amp;quot;capital&amp;quot; that shareholders could own in a law firm or a consulting firm or an investment bank? The employees? They walk out the door at night...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What went wrong?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Technology &amp;quot;makes human judgment redundant&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-- Structural changes (public companies)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Competition on a transactional basis (vs. enduring relationships)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Managing risk through (purported) diversification =&amp;gt; false sense of security?&lt;br /&gt;
-- GREED =&amp;gt; downside borne by the public&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why do people play games in the real world?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Escape reality, kill time&lt;br /&gt;
-- Develop mastery, pursue achievements&lt;br /&gt;
-- Competition =&amp;gt; with friends!&lt;br /&gt;
-- Structure interaction with friends =&amp;gt; both acquaintances (get to know people better) and close friends (excuse to spend time together)&lt;br /&gt;
Problems: maybe hard, maybe boring, losing is no fun, scheduling challenges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zynga uses of Facebook Platform:&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Pro-social engineering&lt;br /&gt;
-- Go and help your friends harvest some eggplant! =&amp;gt; cooperative, building together&lt;br /&gt;
-- Friends will drive game selection =&amp;gt; play with your buddies&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Anti-social engineering&lt;br /&gt;
-- Constant barrage of FarmVille posts =&amp;gt; game may cost you a friendship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business consequences:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Free customer acquisition via newsfeed and direct message (awkward?)&lt;br /&gt;
2. Heightened retention: &amp;quot;Come and help me out!&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; aided by game elements: the games are easy and simplistic and bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great social strategy: eBay Group Buying&lt;br /&gt;
1. User X opts-in&lt;br /&gt;
2. User X picks a gift for User Y&lt;br /&gt;
3. eBay posts group buying message on User X&#39;s profile: visible to mutual friends of X and Y; invisible to Y&lt;br /&gt;
Business outcome: avg successful gift has 4.2 participants, sells for 5x avg eBay sale price =&amp;gt; people spend more money if they&#39;re spending it with their friends (solves social failures)&lt;br /&gt;
Side benefits: participants return to eBay site 4x on average, one-third of participants open a new PayPal account.&lt;br /&gt;
With zero marginal cost to eBay!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Morgan Stanley Risk-Reward Framework / Valuation in Practice (BAV, Tuesday, Week 11)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/morgan-stanley-risk-reward-framework-valuation-in-practice-bav-tuesday-week-11/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/morgan-stanley-risk-reward-framework-valuation-in-practice-bav-tuesday-week-11/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley moves to a more-nuanced standard for analyst reports. Good idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Sketching out bull/bear/base cases =&amp;gt; forces a more fundamentals-based approach&lt;br /&gt;
-- Explicitly surfaces critical uncertainties&lt;br /&gt;
-- Greater transparency, CYA&lt;br /&gt;
-- Forces analysts to question assumptions and consider the downside&lt;br /&gt;
-- Provokes conversation, accommodates customer heterogeneity&lt;br /&gt;
*** Enables analysts to lay out a bear case without alienating company and destroying future access to management&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Is this really innovative? Everyone does this...&lt;br /&gt;
-- No clear decision/recommendation, lack of commitment&lt;br /&gt;
-- Too much transparency? Some of these reports are bad...&lt;br /&gt;
-- False sense of certainty&lt;br /&gt;
-- Pressure on top analysts to change; may drive them away&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes a good sell-side research analyst? What do analysts do?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Industry knowledge&lt;br /&gt;
-- Access to company management&lt;br /&gt;
-- Stock-picking ability&lt;br /&gt;
Premium for all-star analysts =&amp;gt; Institutional Investor grading&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still room for improvement:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Can simplify probability inferences and/or report options market&#39;s inferred probability of each scenario&lt;br /&gt;
-- Could give some flexibility to &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; analysts =&amp;gt; one-size-fits-all isn&#39;t always correct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General thoughts&lt;br /&gt;
Risk-reward framework enables better justification of negative reports, may be more informative, and lowers the probability of &amp;quot;herding&amp;quot; in analyst assessments.&lt;br /&gt;
But there are limits to one-size-fits-all, and it&#39;s harder to do quality control on complex reports.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe this is not that innovative, maybe it should be easy to copy. But research reports had not changed in decades...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>LinkedIn / Valuation of High-Growth Firms (BAV, Monday, Week 11)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/linkedin-valuation-of-high-growth-firms-bav-monday-week-11/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/linkedin-valuation-of-high-growth-firms-bav-monday-week-11/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How much is LinkedIn worth? We have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue streams&lt;br /&gt;
Recruiters: access to user data, $ for job postings&lt;br /&gt;
Advertisers: targeted ads (favorable member demographics)&lt;br /&gt;
Premium membership: additional features&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key factors for success:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Leadership in professional networking; network-effects business&lt;br /&gt;
-- HR is a huge industry&lt;br /&gt;
-- Growth in member base, successful outreach to corporate customers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks:&lt;br /&gt;
-- International expansion: two entrenched competitors&lt;br /&gt;
-- User engagement: low versus Facebook (maybe)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Hard to open up data to third parties (advertising is not as easy on professional sites)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Existing job boards (&lt;a href=&quot;http://monster.com/&quot;&gt;Monster.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we do a valuation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiples:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Some rough comparables, but is OpenTable really a good comp for LinkedIn?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Metrics are bad --- EBITDA/FCF are less meaningful for rapidly-growing firms&lt;br /&gt;
-- Base year --- huge differences between 2010 and 2011 financials&lt;br /&gt;
NOT GOOD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentals (Abnormal earnings):&lt;br /&gt;
-- Highly sensitive to revenue growth --- how well can we estimate this?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Uncertain margins --- revenue streams have different margins, and it&#39;s not clear which will be significant in the future&lt;br /&gt;
-- Unclear beta --- sensitive to business cycle? mitigated by subscription model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaway: It is really hard to evaluate early-stage companies. Most of the value lies in expectations, and the firm has clear incentives to hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to spot a bubble/mis-pricing:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Ask yourself: Are the expectations embedded in this price realistic?&lt;br /&gt;
If LinkedIn has to capture 90% of global HR market, probably yes.&lt;br /&gt;
If LinkedIn has to capture 2% of global HR market, maybe no.&lt;br /&gt;
-- What will a good comparable be in 10 years? Is this a winner-take-all market?&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How the heck can Facebook monetize?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Display Ads --- mediocre results&lt;br /&gt;
Why ads don&#39;t work well on social platforms:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Wrong context (salesman pulls up a chair at your family dinner table)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Harms user experience&lt;br /&gt;
-- No purchasing intent (vs. search engine, which have &amp;gt;2% CTR)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted ads (age/geography/education/gender/religion/interests) --- somewhat better results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friend-approved, brand-generated content --- great&lt;br /&gt;
The real goldmine: the &amp;quot;Like&amp;quot; button&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; Friend-posted ads = 10x higher CTR. Why? surprise, relevance, FEAR OF MISSING OUT&lt;br /&gt;
And your friend endorsed it --- doesn&#39;t look like advertising!&lt;br /&gt;
But why do people tolerate --- and even welcome --- app-generated content?&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; People want content. And people hate writing --- ~25% of active Facebook users have blank profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brand pages --- mixed bag&lt;br /&gt;
As a one-way channel to communicate with fans --- maybe good&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; Cheap way to talk to users and share content, BUT preaching to the converted (users already opted in)&lt;br /&gt;
Upside: shareable stories; maybe good content goes viral and builds awareness with friends&lt;br /&gt;
As a channel for fans to communicate with brand and with each other --- not so great&lt;br /&gt;
Upside: feedback on customer experience&lt;br /&gt;
Downside: probably not good feedback (people tend to post complaints), brands forfeit control over their image (can&#39;t really moderate/curate your brand page; it&#39;s creepy)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Platform (access to everything but users&#39; &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; history; capability to post to profile) --- jackpot&lt;br /&gt;
Examples: FarmVille posts to my profile when I play, horoscope app posts to my profile every day with zero input from me, EventBrite posts ticket purchases on my profile.&lt;br /&gt;
EventBrite: I buy a Lady Gaga ticket. EventBrite posts to my profile --- free advertising for Lady Gaga, social proof of event&#39;s awesomeness! Very high CTR! My friend buys a ticket, and the cycle repeats itself.&lt;br /&gt;
Is there really any better advertising than &amp;quot;your friend bought this&amp;quot;?&lt;br /&gt;
EventBrite says the average write-back is worth $2.50 !!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaways: the best social strategies solve users&#39; social failures.&lt;br /&gt;
People hate generating content. Do it for them...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Sole-Sourcing the Intel 386 (CMC, Wednesday, Week 10)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/sole-sourcing-the-intel-386-cmc-wednesday-week-10/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/sole-sourcing-the-intel-386-cmc-wednesday-week-10/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 1987, a smallish component supplier called Intel unveils the 80386 processor and --- in a break with industry tradition --- announces that it will not license the chip for manufacture by other second-source suppliers (AMD, National Semi, etc.). IBM, the colossus that invented the personal computer, decides not to buy initially.&lt;br /&gt;
Intel goes on to build a massive franchise. IBM gets crushed by clones and eventually exits the personal computer business altogether in 2005. Huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value migration: IBM to Intel&lt;br /&gt;
IBM: closed system, no interoperability, outsourced components, bets on BIOS (bad decision)&lt;br /&gt;
Intel: second-sourcing to boost sales of architecture (becomes increasingly unfeasible at R&amp;amp;D costs rise), backwards-compatibility, continuous investment in R&amp;amp;D&lt;br /&gt;
Classic story of modularity and interdependence (see BSSE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this inevitable? Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;
Uncertainty over use (Apple ad: &amp;quot;What would you do with a personal computer?&amp;quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
Uncertainty over performance-defining sub-component&lt;br /&gt;
Changing IP protections&lt;br /&gt;
Purposeful decision by Intel to license initially and convince competitors to stop R&amp;amp;D investment&lt;br /&gt;
Operational challenges for Intel in meeting demand themselves (fabs = high fixed cost, long lag to build)&lt;br /&gt;
Semi-conductor slump begins in 1984 --- Intel has been performing terribly for two consecutive years; might want to avoid &amp;quot;bet the company&amp;quot; decisions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larger observation: Intel and Microsoft represent a shift from the old model of how firms build massive monopolies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/vertorhoriz1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/vertorhoriz1-1024x804.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;vertorhoriz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rockefeller starts by dominating refining --- one part of the value chain in oil (horizontal integration). Then expands into marketing, transport, exploration, etc., because it makes sense --- Standard Oil can reap all the benefits of improvement in these steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel starts by integrating across design, manufacture, and even branding/marketing of processors (AMD advertises Intel architecture). Then lays waste to all competitors in manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Change in customer profile (consumers buy on brand)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Democratization of capital (this strategy needs $ upfront)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Shift to knowledge goods, where scaling up is easier and cheaper --- if you&#39;ve got the chip everyone wants, it&#39;s not impossible to rapidly double production and double unit sales. Compare to Standard Oil, which cannot quickly double its output.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Related to knowledge goods, intellectual property protection conveys government-sanctioned horizontal monopoly.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Network effects/demand-side economies of scale. Intel processors are much more valuable to a consumer if everyone else uses them and writes code for them. My oil isn&#39;t inherently any more useful if my neighbor buys from the same refiner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Push-back: Did Intel really go vertical first? I&#39;m not sure --- it seems like they went horizontal first, establishing dominance in processor design/R&amp;amp;D before they made a play to be sole-suppliers.)&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Friendster (CSN, Tuesday, Week 10)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/friendster-csn-tuesday-week-10/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/friendster-csn-tuesday-week-10/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We had had the most effective user acquisition model in the history of history.&amp;quot; -- Kent Lindstrom, Friendster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key questions in developing a business strategy based on social networks:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Is there a real problem?&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Can networks help?&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Are networks better than alternatives?&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Can you actually build a solution?&lt;br /&gt;
(5) Are you the best platform?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social failures are not necessarily moral problems --- we should not assume that solving social failures is always a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; thing. Sometimes solving failures introduces new problems.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: Facebook facilitates cheating on your spouse because it&#39;s much harder to have a wandering eye in the offline world. Social failure? Yes, people want their eyes to wander. &amp;quot;Good&amp;quot; thing? Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can Friendster monetize?&lt;br /&gt;
Dating, social search, social product referrals, city-centric (social Craigslist, plan my social life), personal media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dating: lots of problems and potential for embarrassment; users don&#39;t have tons of connections.&lt;br /&gt;
Social search: Good for subjective/local listings, no help for objective information. Which friends do we care about? Not clearly better than using past search history.&lt;br /&gt;
Trusted referrals: Hard to elicit user-generated content without money (which messes up incentives). Which friends do we care about? Not useful for many goods.&lt;br /&gt;
Trusted listings/social Craigslist: Market is shallow, not clear how network helps (and it may hurt).&lt;br /&gt;
Plan my social life: Untapped (at the time), real potential. But privacy issues, lots of substitutes (email), and you need ALL friends on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This is really hard. Especially because the Friendster tech infrastructure is crumbling...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Accounting for the Intel Pentium Chip Flaw / Contingent Liabilities (BAV, Tuesday, Week 10)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/accounting-for-the-intel-pentium-chip-flaw-contingent-liabilities-bav-tuesday-week-10/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/accounting-for-the-intel-pentium-chip-flaw-contingent-liabilities-bav-tuesday-week-10/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Accounting standards for when/how to recognize uncertain liabilities are highly subjective (unlike rules for, say, when to use a capital vs. operating lease).&lt;br /&gt;
Key factors: liability is probable, size of liability can be reasonably estimated.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, &amp;quot;The Contingent Liabilities&amp;quot; would be a great name for a band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big picture differences between measuring contingent liabilities under US GAAP and IFRS:&lt;br /&gt;
GAAP = &amp;quot;best estimate&amp;quot; of a liability --- so the outcome with the highest probability&lt;br /&gt;
IFRS = probability-weighted average (think about it as if you could securitize the liability), discount to a present value. Each period, recognize interest expense on value of principle and accrued interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Intel, real challenges because the nature of the flaw is known but management policy will determine the size of the liability.&lt;br /&gt;
Key uncertainty: Return rate on flawed Pentiums is unknown. But we can probably estimate it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact on valuation:&lt;br /&gt;
Managers usually want to be conservative (err on the side of larger liability). Why?&lt;br /&gt;
Take a big hit early, only reach into the &amp;quot;cookie jar&amp;quot; once. Label the hit to earnings as &amp;quot;one-time restructuring&amp;quot; and avoid future guesses/downward expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Sino-Forest / Quality of Earnings (BAV, Monday, Week 10)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/sino-forest-quality-of-earnings-bav-monday-week-10/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/sino-forest-quality-of-earnings-bav-monday-week-10/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Buy Story for Sino-Forest:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Better than competitors&lt;br /&gt;
-- Incredibly growth, booming demand&lt;br /&gt;
-- Good relationship with Chinese government&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How good are the financial statements?&lt;br /&gt;
Lots of negatives:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Unclear how they make money.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Unclear how to value assets: impairment factors? control over assets?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Huge jump in A/R, concentrated customers, weird customers (&amp;quot;Affiliated Intermediaries&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
-- No allowance for doubtful accounts.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Related-party transactions.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Weird tax position.&lt;br /&gt;
BUT:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Tons of cash ($1.2B)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Solid operating cash flow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two sources of uncertainty:&lt;br /&gt;
GOVERNANCE: auditor moral hazard, Canadian accounting firm.&lt;br /&gt;
FINANCIALS: How good is earnings quality? Will revenue convert to cash?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big takeaway:&lt;br /&gt;
Earnings quality analysis can raise concerns. But concerns are different from fraud allegations, and we usually can&#39;t discern fraud from financial statements alone.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;mixi: Our first case on a &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; platform. A wildly successful Japanese blogging platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Much smaller than Facebook: avg = 27 friends =&amp;gt; only add &amp;quot;strong friends;&amp;quot; exclude boss and ex&lt;br /&gt;
-- Fictitious names, fake photos&lt;br /&gt;
-- Still friends with strangers...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Lengthy diary entries: one paragraph or more, lots of comments&lt;br /&gt;
-- Expectation of privacy: see &amp;quot;footprints&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-- High impact/meaning to friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Leaves footprints (imagine if you could see who viewed your Facebook profile): prevents stalking&lt;br /&gt;
-- Strangers can read...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still &amp;quot;meet&amp;quot; elements even though it&#39;s a &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; product...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who uses this?&lt;br /&gt;
Narrow set of users, small proportion of Japanese population (18-27) =&amp;gt; LOW virality&lt;br /&gt;
Typical of friend platforms: you don&#39;t invite everyone you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the appeal in Japan?&lt;br /&gt;
More normative bounds on behavior = more social failures&lt;br /&gt;
Hard to meet people, in-person friend interactions highly structured&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On monetization:&lt;br /&gt;
Monetization is much easier on &amp;quot;meet&amp;quot; platforms than &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; platforms. You can just charge --- it&#39;s really hard to meet new people.&lt;br /&gt;
Friend platforms must monetize indirectly: large user bases, depend on virality and/or high engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On engagement (data from a several &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; platforms):&lt;br /&gt;
-- Fully 70% of activity is stalking (reading about others).&lt;br /&gt;
-- Read is always controllable! Add footprints (or something like it).&lt;br /&gt;
-- Why is Facebook really appealing? Because it is really hard to be nosy in real life. But easy on FB!&lt;/p&gt;

-- Pursue win-win opportunities&lt;br /&gt;
-- Voluntary&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps along the way &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; European Coal &amp;amp; Steel Community (&#39;52): Create economic interdependence in strategic resource Avoid further Franco-German wars over Ruhr and Alsace-Lorraine Treaties of Rome (&#39;57/&#39;58): Fix tariff policy Institutionalize single market in goods, cap subsidies to &amp;quot;national champion&amp;quot; firms European Monetary System (&#39;79): After Bretton Woods, need currency stability and limits on devaluation (distort growth) Single Europe Act/Common Market (&#39;86): Fix non-tariff policies Open trade in services, people, and capital; remove non-tariff barriers (NTBs) BUT need to compensate poor countries for inability to protect nascent industries Maastricht (&#39;92): European social and political unification Free capital movement...but weaker countries get cheap money! And then it goes off the rails... Lisbon Agenda (&#39;00): Catch up on productivity growth, fix labor inflexibility What goes wrong? Integration fatigue? - Moral suasion only, opt-out is possible - Threatens sovereignty - Diversity/number of members - More competition based on wages/taxes - Immigration - More &amp;quot;center-left&amp;quot; governments So what happens now? Definitely: more fiscal coordination, simplify EU institutions, mutual recognition of training/job qualifications BUT: More integration? &amp;quot;Bigger is better.&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OR &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; Dis-aggregate? Smaller = more accountable, focus on integration issues not country-specific issues.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Georges Doriot and American Venture Capital (CMC, Friday, Week 9)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/georges-doriot-and-american-venture-capital-cmc-friday-week-9/"/>

		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/georges-doriot-and-american-venture-capital-cmc-friday-week-9/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why did the VC model arise post-WWII?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Hard for small, risky firms to access capital =&amp;gt; banks won&#39;t lend&lt;br /&gt;
-- Revenue Act of 1940 =&amp;gt; higher taxes, probably doesn&#39;t deter investment but greater need for individual investors to pool risk&lt;br /&gt;
-- US Government funding for war R&amp;amp;D =&amp;gt; de-risks follow-on investment&lt;br /&gt;
-- US Government created wartime partnerships between universities and industry&lt;br /&gt;
-- GI Bill =&amp;gt; higher ed is more broadly accessible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georges Doriot: HBS professor, American soldier, visionary investor&lt;br /&gt;
-- Firm believer in possibility of managing entrepreneurship&lt;br /&gt;
-- Dispenses money AND advice&lt;br /&gt;
-- Already had created a pool of analysts (HBS students)&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Central node&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; deep industry connections, networker&lt;br /&gt;
-- Portfolio theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Research and Development Corporation (ARD) -- founded in 1946&lt;br /&gt;
-- Shifts industry focus with the times: chemicals =&amp;gt; diverse sector choices =&amp;gt; electronics&lt;br /&gt;
-- Access to capital: lots of individual investors, permanent fund (closed-end)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Portfolio management: takes controlling stake in enterprises and actively manages (board seats)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Capital gains and consulting fees (looks more like contemporary PE, but they also started off with less risky investments/more hits than modern VC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big deal about ARD: foresight to invest on an unproven thesis&lt;br /&gt;
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC): ARD invests in 1957, IPO in 1961, 81% IRR/375x returns over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;
Proves the model...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent evolution in VC firm structure:&lt;br /&gt;
ARD:&lt;br /&gt;
-- sells shares at Net Asset Value on public markets (like an ETF)&lt;br /&gt;
-- investors have liquidity via secondary market&lt;br /&gt;
-- General Partners are salaried&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited Partnerships:&lt;br /&gt;
-- 10 year fund lifetime (usually), limited liquidity&lt;br /&gt;
-- GPs earn fee (2%) and carried interest (20%)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Unequal distribution of fund upside among GPs (older GPs make more, usually)&lt;br /&gt;
BUT hard to retain good GPs; easy to break off and start another fund once you have a reputation...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, trend away from &amp;quot;royalty model&amp;quot; of compensation and towards &amp;quot;insurance model&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-- Junior partners see a piece of the upside&lt;br /&gt;
-- Decreases attrition of good GPs, allows VC firms to build a brand. Helps explain persistence of returns??&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 1946, Ford is in dire straits. They hire ten former Army Air Corps officers who revolutionized the use of statistical analysis in the military during WW2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems with Ford in &#39;46:&lt;br /&gt;
GM is now market leader&lt;br /&gt;
Losing $10M/mo, about three years away from bankruptcy&lt;br /&gt;
Finance, accounting, control = nonexistent&lt;br /&gt;
Chaotic organizational structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did the problems start? Henry Ford...&lt;br /&gt;
Fired his accountants, hired bad managers, churned out cars, averse to innovation (produces the original Model T for 19 years), no plans, abusive manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brings to mind another stellar individual:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;John Patterson, the founder of National Cash Register and one of the greatest businessmen of the gilded age, once notified an employee that he was being sacked by setting fire to his desk.&amp;quot; -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/node/14844995?story_id=14844995&quot;&gt;Economist article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Henry Ford&#39;s grandson (28 y/o) becomes President and hires the Whiz Kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance drivers in auto firms:&lt;br /&gt;
Assembly process (manufacturing)&lt;br /&gt;
Cycle time (parts and inventory)&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good cost accounting =&amp;gt; Whiz Kids!&lt;br /&gt;
Labor efficiency&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Design (emotional experience) -&amp;gt; Henry Ford?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Whiz Kids bring focus on results, data-driven approach to turn-around, outsider&#39;s perspective, and they&#39;re brilliant. BUT they know nothing about the auto business.&lt;br /&gt;
Presages continual tension between quantitative analysis and qualitative operational knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the Whiz Kids implement change:&lt;br /&gt;
-- FINANCE at the center =&amp;gt; easy to measure&lt;br /&gt;
-- Everybody hates them; clash extensively with hires from GM.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Itemize car parts (coherent plan for costing)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Measure outcomes =&amp;gt; produces short term focus? hurts R&amp;amp;D? long-run problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert McNamara --- presides over the greatest product flop in modern business, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsel&quot;&gt;Ford Edsel&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Edsel1000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ford Edsel&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But he didn&#39;t want to bring it to market! Cause or effect --- who knows?&lt;br /&gt;
Rises to become President of Ford, moves over to SecDef, the rest is history...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy&quot;&gt;The McNamara Fallacy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is OK as far as it goes. The second step is to disregard that which can&#39;t be easily measured or to give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading. The third step is to presume that what can&#39;t be measured easily really isn&#39;t important. This is blindness. The fourth step is to say that what can&#39;t be easily measured really doesn&#39;t exist. This is suicide.&amp;quot; -- Dan Yankelovich&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legacy of McNamara&lt;br /&gt;
-- Intellectual arrogance, rigid division between managers and workers (leaders are anointed MBAs with book-learning).&lt;br /&gt;
-- Anything that cannot be quantified is meaningless.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Was he really quantitative? Plenty of suggestions that McNamara usually made up his mind first and then tried to find data to support it...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Vietnam: remarkable growth since first moves away from centrally-planned economy in 1987. Will growth continue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How a communist country maintained 7.7% GDP growth for 34 years (1986-2010):&lt;br /&gt;
-- Started out poor (ninth-poorest country in the world circa &#39;86)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Favorable investment policies (allowed foreign ownership, opened to FDI, simplified permitting, EPZs, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Favorable macro policies (convertible currency [mostly], property rights, diplomatic normalization/&amp;quot;became a good citizen&amp;quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Cold War ends =&amp;gt; can&#39;t rely on aid from Russia anymore (Counterpoint: start relying on aid from Western world...)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Riding wave of regional prosperity (neighbors grow even faster!)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Stable, centralized government&lt;br /&gt;
-- Consistent and slow privatization (&amp;quot;equitization&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns moving forward:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Privatizing SOEs =&amp;gt; Pace has been slow so far. Is it really necessary? Can government make it happen?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Bad higher education, bad infrastructure, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Corrupt (sort of).&lt;br /&gt;
-- Inflation, real estate bubble (?), general macro worries.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Immature clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;===&amp;gt; Big takeaways &amp;lt;=== Social and economic policy are inextricably linked. Old-school guidance to developing nations -- implement Washington Consensus ASAP -- doesn&#39;t usually get implemented right/looks flawed. The European Union: whatever its failings, EU did an incredible job at getting tons of countries to enact economic/governance reforms. Required for membership!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Option Backdating at UnitedHealth (BAV, Wednesday, Week 9)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/option-backdating-at-unitedhealth-bav-wednesday-week-9/"/>
		<updated>2012-03-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/option-backdating-at-unitedhealth-bav-wednesday-week-9/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;CEO compensation for Bill McGuire:&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;extraordinary&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; cash salary/bonus = $45M, options = $300M&lt;br /&gt;
-- BUT he built UnitedHealth. Market cap has grown by a factor of 50 under his tenure (1991-2005); shareholders overwhelmingly approve of him and his compensation package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to account for stock options? Fair value.&lt;br /&gt;
Intrinsic value:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Expense = 0 (non-cash charge)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Footnote on annual report&lt;br /&gt;
-- Appears as dilution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair value:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Comparability between firms&lt;br /&gt;
-- Matching principal (&amp;quot;cost&amp;quot; of options spread over vesting period)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Use options pricing methodology (Black Scholes) to value options at issuance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To other huge problem: backdating.&lt;br /&gt;
Retroactive choice of grant date =&amp;gt; greater dilution for shareholders, greater moral hazard&lt;br /&gt;
Is it illegal? No, not if it&#39;s transparent --- just issuing options at below-market strike price...&lt;br /&gt;
Another controversial trend: &amp;quot;spring loading&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; timing options issuance to immediately precede good news&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this a big deal for UnitedHealth? Should it impact valuation?&lt;br /&gt;
Market cap declines by $20B. Impact of backdating: maybe $400M.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe fundamentals unaffected, but:&lt;br /&gt;
Management distraction from lawsuit, SEC investigation, trust in management/board (worse because UnitedHealth is an insurer), possible departure of high-performing CEO, political pressure, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
A fine mess...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2005, LinkedIn has 5M subscribers and needs to start monetizing. Offer &amp;quot;premium&amp;quot; accounts with better search, or offer paid messaging to people outside your network?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring problems that LinkedIn solves &amp;lt;&amp;lt; Search: In offline world, recruiters ask friends/contacts if they know anyone with qualification X. Several referrals (talk to my friend at company Y, ask her if she knows anyone) gets them to a candidate. - Incentive to act: middle links in referral chain have no vested interest in success of search - Recruiters can&#39;t ask too often; it gets annoying - Middle links in referral chain have to vouch for strangers - Referral chain is not clear; recruiters need to know who to ask At the time, LinkedIn has 5M members, but average &amp;quot;reach&amp;quot; (members within four connections) is only 50K! Search is not working great. Solution: convert from original model (brokered meet platform) to a bar. Solves other problems for job seekers: - Might not be looking for a job (busy; don&#39;t know what opportunities are available) - Sends adverse message to current employer: it&#39;s not okay to be job seeking&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Twitter (CSN, Tuesday, Week 9)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/twitter-csn-tuesday-week-9/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The main competitor for meet platforms? Reality --- it&#39;s pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter: started as a friend platform, now mostly a meet platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet vs. friend platforms:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/meetvsfriend.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/meetvsfriend-1024x606.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;meetvsfriend&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
May be a false dichotomy because most meet platforms use &amp;quot;friend features,&amp;quot; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter&#39;s Breadth:&lt;br /&gt;
500M users now! How?&lt;br /&gt;
-- SxSW launch =&amp;gt; Misconception. Look at user count; basically doesn&#39;t change...&lt;br /&gt;
-- Celebrities =&amp;gt; Yes, but mass adoption did not happen when first celebs hopped on.&lt;br /&gt;
-- WoM =&amp;gt; Not really.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Media! =&amp;gt; Twitter provides natural complement for old media: timely reaction to events; new source of news; instant dialogue. Big bumps from Rick Sanchez Live, Mumbai bombing, and Beijing Olympics.&lt;br /&gt;
Twitter unintentionally created a platform that was a natural complement to network news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson: Borrow someone else&#39;s traffic. Create a platform that serves as a natural complement a pre-existing, high-traffic platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter&#39;s Search:&lt;br /&gt;
Terrible. Hard to find people, no guidance, no response to most tweets, hard/not natural to post recycled content (compare to Pinterest or Foursquare).&lt;br /&gt;
Hashtags are rarely used (3% of tweets).&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You are more likely to get a message as a man on OkayCupid than to get a follower on Twitter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interaction:&lt;br /&gt;
Really hard/unintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to monetize? Ummm....&lt;br /&gt;
Ads: targeted discounts/tweets? No one hears you, and users have no purchase intent.&lt;br /&gt;
Data: sell analytics? We don&#39;t know who Twitter users actually are; minimal demographic information and sentiment analysis via Twitter is notoriously unreliable.&lt;br /&gt;
Other options are no good either...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Eddie Bauer in 2005 / Post-Bankruptcy Valuation (BAV, Monday, Week 9)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/eddie-bauer-in-2005-post-bankruptcy-valuation-bav-monday-week-9/"/>
		<updated>2012-03-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/eddie-bauer-in-2005-post-bankruptcy-valuation-bav-monday-week-9/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Eddie Bauer emerges from bankruptcy that stemmed mostly from problems with its parent company. EB has been on a downward slide for 5 years. How much is this thing worth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting Analysis:&lt;br /&gt;
Large chunk of balance sheet is Deferred Tax Asset (arises from NOLs, evaporates if company is sold) and Goodwill (big increase due to recapitalization/bankruptcy).&lt;br /&gt;
All real estate is operating leases: might want to make these capital leases...&lt;br /&gt;
Substantial reorganization expenses in &#39;04 and &#39;05, probably want to adjust if we use history to forecast future income statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fresh start&amp;quot; accounting: emerging from bankruptcy, assets and liabilities on balance sheet are adjusted to fair value (same as purchase accounting), mapped onto bankruptcy court&#39;s determination of the firm&#39;s value.&lt;br /&gt;
Impact:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Assets that were fully depreciated (think factories) are not anymore. Income statement usually looks worse due to higher depreciation (more expenses). Competing incentives in measuring asset values:&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; Under-report value of assets: boosts future ROA&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; Over-report value of assets: better if owners want to sell soon; restructuring plan needs to be accepted by court/creditors (and that is more likely with more assets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Analysis:&lt;br /&gt;
No-good-very-bad historical performance.&lt;br /&gt;
BUT, means aggressive sales growth projections for the near future may be justified. Starting point is really low...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuation:&lt;br /&gt;
Abnormal earnings method is NOT really built for firms where book value = fair value.&lt;br /&gt;
Write-up in book value (goodwill) captures what we would otherwise try to model in a valuation. For Eddie Bauer valuation, almost everything in share price comes from beginning book value.&lt;br /&gt;
So if we think that some of the book value got arbitrarily written up (goodwill increase to make A = L + E), we probably want to either just value the firm at book OR do abnormal earnings but adjust for the increase...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Central America / Cross-National Regions (MOC, Monday, Week 9)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/central-america-cross-national-regions-moc-monday-week-9/"/>
		<updated>2012-03-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/central-america-cross-national-regions-moc-monday-week-9/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New model of regional economic cooperation: more than just free trade areas.&lt;br /&gt;
Regional strategy can: improve investment climate, expand available markets, drive better business environment, enable effective transnational clusters.&lt;br /&gt;
Particularly important for small countries with lots of natural disasters...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, CACM in Central America fails:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Conceived to further import substitution agenda; all sorts of problems&lt;br /&gt;
-- Requires member countries to give up national sovereignty in impractical ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some progress with CAA, but still slow going/stalled:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Biggest successes: low-hanging fruit (investment promotion, coordinate tourism)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Cultural integrity across Central American nations? Not all it&#39;s cracked up to be; still huge disparities in economic development, policy goals, and motivation. AND unstable political landscape.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Degree of buy-in may vary --- Honduras doesn&#39;t get much out of the Central American Logistical Corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great potential for gains from strategizing with neighbors, but challenging to implement...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Brinks / BHS Spinoff (BAV, Tuesday, Week 9)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/brinks-bhs-spinoff-bav-tuesday-week-9/"/>
		<updated>2012-03-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/brinks-bhs-spinoff-bav-tuesday-week-9/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What kind of companies attract activist investors:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Mismanaged =&amp;gt; get on board, influence/replace management&lt;br /&gt;
-- Conglomerates =&amp;gt; Valued at less than the sum of its parts&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Unlock&amp;quot; value on B/S (ex. real estate) =&amp;gt; undervaluation/suboptimal capital structure; short vs. long-term&lt;br /&gt;
-- Ownership structure =&amp;gt; Easy to seize control/accumulate a position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Brinks undervalued? Probably.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes: room to take on debt, market leader, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
No: not feasible to &amp;quot;unlock.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged Recap?&lt;br /&gt;
Take on debt, pay cash to shareholders/repurchase, gain Interest Tax Shield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinoff?&lt;br /&gt;
Good idea: Brand will not be important to BHS, firm is more attractive to a strategic buyer in two parts.&lt;br /&gt;
Bad idea: Lose synergies (overhead, cross-selling, risk mgmt), BHS is barely cashflow positive, can&#39;t really license brand in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, it is not clear that there was any benefit to spinning off Brinks and BHS...&lt;br /&gt;
Rebranding was costly; BHS portion was eventually bought by Tyco.&lt;br /&gt;
Combined equity value of Brinks and BHS had been basically flat since spinoff; S&amp;amp;P 500 increased 19%.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Next step for Meetup in 2009: better engage existing users or attract more users?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get more users. Why? Because double output of funnel by increasing sign-up rate from 5 to 10% than by increasing show up rate from 50% to 100%...&lt;br /&gt;
Conversion funnel:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/funnel3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/funnel3-1024x572.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;funnel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ways to get traffic/users:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Traditional Advertising&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Virality/WoM&lt;br /&gt;
--- Friend-to-friend (F2F): very low for meet sites; usually stigma/inherent problems (if you had 10 friends to do activity X, you wouldn&#39;t need a meet platform)&lt;br /&gt;
--- Stranger-to-stranger (S2S): potentially effective; prospective new user sees something about meet site on Twitter, a blog, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Product-driven traffic: usually least effective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How big a problem is this in the industry: &#39;I will build a killer product and peeps will come.&#39;&amp;quot; -- M.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating Meetup:&lt;br /&gt;
Breadth =&amp;gt; not good&lt;br /&gt;
Search =&amp;gt; works quite well: profiles, opportunities to display interesting, waiting list feature&lt;br /&gt;
Interaction =&amp;gt; not great: organizer (not Meetup) controls user experience, requires tons of time/commitment to be a good organizer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Atkins (former Chief Community Officer):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- UX is not really under Meetup&#39;s control&lt;br /&gt;
-- Meetup core use case: find &amp;quot;like others&amp;quot; for people with new need, NOT social failures/flawed people&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; Users tend to have changed geographies or life circumstances (new mother)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic for engaging people in a new activity: make a series of increasingly-demanding asks&lt;br /&gt;
Example: political campaign&lt;br /&gt;
Step 1) Sign up on our website&lt;br /&gt;
Step 2) &amp;quot;Like&amp;quot; on Facebook&lt;br /&gt;
Step 3) Give $5&lt;br /&gt;
Step 4) Come to a march&lt;br /&gt;
Step 5) Lead a march&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go straight from Step 1 to Step 5, it doesn&#39;t work and you scare people away.&lt;br /&gt;
Meetup needs to do a better job of facilitating low-investment interaction --- right now, asking you to come to a party where you don&#39;t know anyone. And that&#39;s scary...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Labor Movement Between the Wars / UAW vs. General Motors (CMC, Thursday, Week 8)</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A testament to the current state of labor relations in America: the NYC public schoolday ends at 2:57 and 30 seconds. Compromise is a strange beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trends in labor in the 1920s:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Welfare capitalism (cooperative company unions)&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; &amp;quot;share the wealth&amp;quot; ... but not sharing much of the power, claims of injustice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- AF of L&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; militant to &amp;quot;necessary auxiliary&amp;quot; to schism/CIO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- CIO (and expansion across multiple industries)&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L._Lewis&quot;&gt;John L. Lewis&lt;/a&gt;: fosters disconnect between workers and managers OR creates value?&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; pivotal role in building the system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Role of government&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; regulatory powers, generally sympathetic to unions (Wagner Act: firms must accept collective bargaining)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing separation between managers and works&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; ethnic tensions&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; shift from workers as skilled craftsman to workers as interchangeable cogs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAW vs. GM&lt;br /&gt;
UAW: Big demand = sole bargaining. Also: more union rights, seniority protection, no unjust dismissals, decrease working hours, minimum pay.&lt;br /&gt;
GM: No to everything; labor should stay out of management prerogatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aftermath of the strike in Flint, Mich. (1937)&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Apex of U.S. auto industry = 1955 (almost two decades later)&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Still riding high in 1975&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Japanese competitors pull ahead in 1985 and never really look back.&lt;br /&gt;
And we still have a massive auto industry to bail out in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sloan might blame the unions: capital should&#39;ve been allocated away from dying industries long before. No easy answers...&lt;/p&gt;

-- In line with core competencies&lt;br /&gt;
-- Reputation benefits&lt;br /&gt;

Could this work in other industries/sectors? Cleantech?&lt;br /&gt;
Our intuition is to say government should leave everything to the private sector. But sometimes other models seem to work very well...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Neoprene (CMC, Wednesday, Week 8)</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the throes of the Great Depression, DuPont announces --- with great fanfare --- that they have invented a somewhat-better synthetic version of rubber. Rubber prices are at rock-bottom. What the heck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how bad was the Great Depression?&lt;br /&gt;
GDP down 26%, 1929-1931&lt;br /&gt;
Unemployment &amp;gt; 15%&lt;br /&gt;
Stock market down 73% (1929-1931)&lt;br /&gt;
3,300 banks failed (1929-1931)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont invests in basic R&amp;amp;D --- yields neoprene, nylon, plutonium, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
Pros to investing at the time:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Attract good scientists, set a precedent&lt;br /&gt;
-- Experimentation (stage investment in new products)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Profuse opportunities (obvious at the time?)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Sitting on cash ($20M)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Human capital is cheap&lt;br /&gt;
-- R&amp;amp;D: winner-take-all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;
-- No goals for R&amp;amp;D&lt;br /&gt;
-- Too speculative, not applied, no clear endstate (ex ante)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Need $44M to commercialize neoprene&lt;br /&gt;
-- Diffusion of new products will be slower than usual =&amp;gt; delay R&amp;amp;D?&lt;br /&gt;
-- DuPont makes intermediate goods: need demand from other businesses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why could DuPont do this? Specific capabilities/competencies:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Organizational structure =&amp;gt; M-Form corporation&lt;br /&gt;
-- History of product success =&amp;gt; appetite for long-term commitment&lt;br /&gt;
-- Bridgewater, et al =&amp;gt; experienced midlevel leaders capable of commercializing science&lt;br /&gt;
-- Advertising expertise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal DuPont memo on basic research (Stine). Key points:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Pure academic research (not necessarily applied) =&amp;gt; may NOT lead to practical applications&lt;br /&gt;
-- Internal culture benefits&lt;br /&gt;
-- Proprietary tech&lt;br /&gt;
-- Pipeline to feed new biz&lt;br /&gt;
Still proves tough to manage over the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Carothers&quot;&gt;Wallace Carothers&lt;/a&gt; (star DuPont scientist and a shoe-in for a Nobel Prize) commits suicide in a Philadelphia hotel room in 1937 (cyanide and lemon juice cocktail). Bipolar before, but...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Indonesia / Attracting Foreign Investment (MOC, Tuesday, Week 8)</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not all FDI is created equal.&lt;br /&gt;
Firms seeking low wages are probably not going to make the sorts of investments that will result in dramatic productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does FDI do for a country?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Access to additional capital (from outside country) -&amp;gt; helps Balance of Payments&lt;br /&gt;
-- Improve business environment (maybe)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Create businesses, jobs, wealth, exports (depends on context)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Technology transfer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s attractive about Indonesia (in general)?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Buy assets on the cheap, low wages&lt;br /&gt;
-- Huge population --- 235M people = big domestic market&lt;br /&gt;
-- Natural resources: gas, coal, oil&lt;br /&gt;
-- Bali!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why no FDI under Suharto/Sukarno?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Corruption, lack of transparency&lt;br /&gt;
-- Dislike of foreigners (legacy of Dutch rule) =&amp;gt; Protection of local firms&lt;br /&gt;
-- Volatile&lt;br /&gt;
-- Lots of ethnicities, lots of islands, lots of languages =&amp;gt; hard to build national unity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Suharto was a real capitalist...he owned 471 companies...17% of the market cap!&amp;quot; -- Hiro Takeuchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why no FDI under Reformasi?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Decentralization --- making an investment is complex/takes forever to approve&lt;br /&gt;
-- Still missing infrastructure&lt;br /&gt;
-- Terrorism (Bali bombings in &#39;02, &#39;03, and &#39;05)&lt;br /&gt;
Bottom line: lingering macro and microeconomic problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;br /&gt;
Foreign direct investment is NOT the whole answer to national economic development. FDI policy cannot be isolated from larger national strategic decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Your Social Network Over Time (CSN, Monday, Week 8)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/your-social-network-over-time-csn-monday-week-8/"/>
		<updated>2012-03-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/your-social-network-over-time-csn-monday-week-8/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am a poor judge of social need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don&#39;t have many close friends.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Survey in 2004: 25% of Americans do not have someone they can talk to about serious personal issues (close friend).&lt;br /&gt;
-- Trend over past 25 years or so: more people are good friends with their spouse, fewer people have friends other than their spouse.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Best predictor of your number of close friends: years of education.&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Corollary: Well-educated, high-income people often have bad personal intuition about the value proposition of social media. Because they already have friends...&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Other corollary: Minorities (racial, ethnic, sexual, etc.) are some of the heaviest users of social media. People prefer to associate with others like them (homophily); this often shuts minorities out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old people are alone a lot. Call your grandma.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Average 70-year-old: 185 days a year with no interaction with a close friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparse networks of friends vs. dense networks&lt;br /&gt;
Sparse: better ideas (less groupthink), correlated with income/promotion/success in men. NOT correlated with career success in women (usually need a dense network with a strategic partner/mentor).&lt;br /&gt;
Dense: friends take better care of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great predictor of success in long-term romantic relationships: degree of integration of your social network with your spouse. (Comment: Maybe just increases the &amp;quot;cost&amp;quot; of divorce, keeps marriages together longer than they should last...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest unmet social needs:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Close relationships, esp with family (you can&#39;t pick your relatives)&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Facebook is NOT designed for 70-year-olds.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Distance&lt;br /&gt;
-- Un-intrusive, easy-to-use technology&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Schneider / Square D M&amp;A (BAV, Tuesday, Week 8)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/schneider-square-d-ma-bav-tuesday-week-8/"/>
		<updated>2012-03-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/schneider-square-d-ma-bav-tuesday-week-8/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is this a good fit?&lt;br /&gt;
Pros:&lt;br /&gt;
-- U.S. market entry for Schneider&lt;br /&gt;
-- Square D = mostly residential, Schneider = mostly industrial&lt;br /&gt;
-- Economies of scale (R&amp;amp;D)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Distribution channels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Hostile!&lt;br /&gt;
-- Competing standards =&amp;gt; how good will synergies be?&lt;br /&gt;
-- At what price?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Earnings impact for Schneider (goodwill amortization)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Not a clear turnaround opportunity: Square D mgmt is good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seemingly innocuous assumptions can have serious consequences:&lt;br /&gt;
Lazard DCF valuation for Square D connects sales to change in long-term assets, NOT level of long-term assets. Model projects long-term depreciation (as a percentage of sales) below CAPEX (as a percentage of sales)...so we end up with a massive asset base.&lt;br /&gt;
Takeaway: you probably need to forecast out the balance sheet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about assumptions embedded in the market price of a stock. Large portion of Square D equity value is based on presumed synergies from a merger/M&amp;amp;A premium.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Macroeconomic strategy is really hard sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;
Post-genocide, basically the only thing Rwanda has going for it is that the entire world feels sorry for them.&lt;br /&gt;
Incredible progress over the last 18 years...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government of National Unity strategy (94-00):&lt;br /&gt;
-- SECURITY&lt;br /&gt;
-- Macro policy: curb inflation&lt;br /&gt;
-- Political institutions: basic gov&#39;t, reconciliation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Zero corruption&lt;br /&gt;
-- Prioritizing improvement in infrastructure, logistics&lt;br /&gt;
-- Still trouble attracting FDI...&lt;br /&gt;
-- Dual imperative: maintain security/stability, open up to world/attract FDI&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home Depot current performance (2000) versus past:&lt;br /&gt;
-- More stores (scale/efficiency gains), higher revenue per square foot, higher revenue per transaction (customer loyalty?)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Higher NOPAT margins, but lower asset turnover =&amp;gt; shift from leasing stores to ownership; &amp;quot;clustering&amp;quot; strategy in store expansion&lt;br /&gt;
-- Favorable macro environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth plans:&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Design&amp;quot; stores =&amp;gt; higher margin BUT lower turnover? more sensitive to business cycle? saturated market?&lt;br /&gt;
-- International geographic expansion =&amp;gt; higher cost?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Internet/in-store pickup =&amp;gt; lower COGS BUT less customer service (Home Depot value proposition)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Expansion to professionals and Buy-It-Yourself =&amp;gt; huge markets, big transactions BUT more cyclical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key questions (hard to answer):&lt;br /&gt;
What is terminal sales growth?&lt;br /&gt;
What is correct market risk premium (in hindsight; this was mid-2000)?&lt;br /&gt;
What will long-term NOPAT margins be?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>eHarmony (CSN, Tuesday, Week 8)</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three key activities in every search process: breadth, search, interaction (BSI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any search activity, there are three basic models.&lt;br /&gt;
You can find potential spouses via:&lt;br /&gt;
Your social network: Activities (work, school)&lt;br /&gt;
=====&amp;gt; bad breadth (small pool, homogenous)&lt;br /&gt;
=====&amp;gt; easy search (good knowledge about potential partners)&lt;br /&gt;
=====&amp;gt; easy interaction (already many excuses to talk)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others&#39; networks: Brokered (friends, parents)&lt;br /&gt;
=====&amp;gt; okay breadth (bigger pool than your own acquaintances)&lt;br /&gt;
=====&amp;gt; okay search (rely on others decision-making)&lt;br /&gt;
=====&amp;gt; okay interaction (broker can help determine potential partner&#39;s interest/availability)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chance: Bars (or walking down the street, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
=====&amp;gt; excellent breadth&lt;br /&gt;
=====&amp;gt; bad search (hard to discern compatibility/&amp;quot;quality&amp;quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
=====&amp;gt; bad interaction (hard to &amp;quot;make a move&amp;quot;/creepy, social repercussions, gender norms, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In online dating ====&amp;gt; Facebook = Activity, eHarmony = Brokered, Match/OkCupid = Bars.&lt;br /&gt;
Corollary: if you see a search process where one of these three classes of interaction does not exist, it&#39;s a business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eHarmony Key Factors to Success:&lt;br /&gt;
-- High barriers to entry (long survey, expensive fee, reject &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; applicants)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Matching algorithm (better matches [?], limited choices = easier to pick, lessens social stigma of reaching out)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Limited communication (avoids feast-or-famine problems [women with attractive photos get deluged with messages], increases odds of a response [because the other party doesn&#39;t have tons of choice either])&lt;br /&gt;
-- Guided Communication (answer important questions [location? kids?] early)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you still need bodies on the platform!&lt;br /&gt;
And tons of challenges with marketing --- dating is scary/uncertain. Compare with picking a hair-care product:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If you want to buy shampoo, the shampoo bottle is like, &#39;Uh-huh, I&#39;m going home with you!&#39;&amp;quot; -- Misiek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word-of-mouth advertising doesn&#39;t work well; no one wants to tell their friends they are using an online dating service...&lt;br /&gt;
So customer acquisition cost tends to be very high: ad spend for big sites on the order of 40% of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Stock Market Crash of 1929 // Trouble with a Bubble (CMC, Friday, Week 7)</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Historically, investments made during recessions have delivered some of the best returns.&amp;quot; -- some Bessemer Venture Partners report&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinary downturns in the business cycle can (relatively easily) turn into a depression.&lt;br /&gt;
Tradeoff versus &amp;quot;letting things play out&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;regulatory authority&amp;quot; ==&amp;gt; clearly the optimum is somewhere in the middle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did Irving Fisher --- the greatest economist of his generation --- miss the Great Depression?&lt;br /&gt;
Or, why did a bunch of smart people think that the late 1920s run-up was &amp;quot;the new normal?&amp;quot; (Comment: stop me if this seems eerily similar to rhetoric around 2000/2008)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Radical tech changes&lt;br /&gt;
====&amp;gt; electricity, communications, internal combustion engine&lt;br /&gt;
====&amp;gt; &amp;quot;different from the past&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
====&amp;gt; new R&amp;amp;D capabilities inside firms&lt;br /&gt;
====&amp;gt; emerging giants: GE, RCA&lt;br /&gt;
====&amp;gt; hard to value R&amp;amp;D and firms&#39; intellectual property&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Management practice changes&lt;br /&gt;
====&amp;gt; Scientific management&lt;br /&gt;
====&amp;gt; New, more efficient organization methods for firms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Labor utilization/relations&lt;br /&gt;
====&amp;gt; virtuous circle: higher standard of living creates more demand creates better firms, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons for the Crash&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Federal Reserve response =&amp;gt; tighten credit, send contradictory messages&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Leverage =&amp;gt; one-third of individual investors trading on margin; downturn forces margin calls and mass liquidation&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Overproduction =&amp;gt; problems forecasting demand; overinvestment in capital goods&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Gold standard =&amp;gt; interest rates rise, gold flows out of U.S.&lt;br /&gt;
(5) Low barriers to stock ownership =&amp;gt; fuels bubble in equity prices&lt;br /&gt;
(6) Inflexible banking sector =&amp;gt; tons of tiny banks; regulations against interstate banking&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maidenform and the development/commercialization of the bra:&lt;br /&gt;
A positive example of what emerged from rapid urbanization and social/economic transformation in American cities. Compare to Al Capone...&lt;br /&gt;

Lucky? And incredibly savvy. Builds company with $4K of invested capital.&lt;br /&gt;
Takes charge of finances and marketing; husband does product design&lt;br /&gt;
And still pays herself less than her husband and makes William Rosenthal the company&#39;s President&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a product of NYC:&lt;br /&gt;
Garment district/fashion cluster&lt;br /&gt;
Changing role of women; business in the home = possible&lt;br /&gt;

Even at the start, advertising tone is aspirational/wishy-washy (I think) =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;I dreamed...&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;I am...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Corporate culture: pin-up of the month =&amp;gt; selling sex/desire from men from the start (I think)&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Singapore: real national strategy; remarkable continuity/national alignment in goals.&lt;br /&gt;
Successful in building state-owned firms AND in forcing/allowing them to compete with the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;
(Commentary: An awesome triumph in a small nation. But how relevant is this from the perspective of national strategy? Everyone wanted to be in IT in the 90s, everyone wanted to be in financial services and biotech in 00s, and everyone wants to cultivate tons of entrepreneurs right now. Is this really strategy, or just brilliant execution?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Yeo&quot;&gt;George Yeo&lt;/a&gt;: former Singaporean Minister for Foreign Affairs, HBS graduate, and really savvy guy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore has two key sources of insecurity:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Very small nation&lt;br /&gt;
-- Three-quarters Chinese =&amp;gt; In SE Asia, where many nations are uneasy about Chinese influence.&lt;br /&gt;
And Singapore must make a living in that environment...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural arbitrage is a sustainable advantage: it&#39;s hard to build a society that successfully integrates many peoples, religions, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
And when you do, it&#39;s not easy to copy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never get enamored of a product/service. If your current focus is not the way forward, you need to give it up.&lt;br /&gt;
(In Singaporean context, tons of cluster change/development over the past 55 years)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never lose internal unity/cohesion. Nations and societies can only move quickly if they have a high degree of unity.&lt;br /&gt;
Income inequality (&amp;quot;town/gown harmony&amp;quot;) =&amp;gt; conspicuous consumption is dangerous and destructive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan for ethnic and religious strains.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If a bomb goes off in the middle of our capital, we will do X, Y, and Z to avoid chaos and hatred.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Make people write down their plans, because otherwise they will not remember them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fun is serious business.&amp;quot; -- George Yeo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(IFC in the developing world)&lt;br /&gt;

KFS: wide membership, international collaboration (Germany), collective action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;br /&gt;
-- It&#39;s really hard to measure success in developing economies. Acoplasticos is considered incredibly effective in Colombia.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Building IFCs: you still have to pick industries to develop/consider opportunity cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(IFC in the developed world)&lt;br /&gt;
Activities: creates new products, contract R&amp;amp;D, spins out new startups&lt;br /&gt;
66 member firms! Startups compete with some of them...&lt;br /&gt;
Works really well in Switzerland; might not work elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do IFCs exist?&lt;br /&gt;
Market imperfections =&amp;gt; transaction costs, externalities, imperfect information, natural monopolies (in collecting industry data, for example)&lt;br /&gt;
Government failure =&amp;gt; inadequate provisioning of infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing-economy ISCs: greater tendency towards corrective &amp;quot;gap filling&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Advanced-economy ISCs: usually focus on increasing coordination between firms, government, and universities&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Foursquare (LTV, Monday, Week 7)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/foursquare-ltv-monday-week-7/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hunch-driven entrepreneurship at its finest...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did Foursquare succeed when Dodgeball failed?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Smartphones existed.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Social networks more mature (Facebook, Twitter) =&amp;gt; lower CAC&lt;br /&gt;
-- Splashy PR launch SxSW&lt;br /&gt;
-- More gameification (see also, smartphones)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Launched in NYC =&amp;gt; large, young, tech-savvy market; trend-setters&lt;br /&gt;
(Commentary: Is this really a Lean startup? Try the same idea after it failed/worked out mediocre the first time; change almost nothing conceptually and don&#39;t do much testing/metric-driven development?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big takeaway: context and timing make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Foursquare have Product-Market Fit? (I say yes)&lt;br /&gt;
Pro:&lt;br /&gt;
Strong engagement metrics&lt;br /&gt;
15M users&lt;br /&gt;
Passionate users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti:&lt;br /&gt;
CVP is weak/fuzzy&lt;br /&gt;
Haven&#39;t (Can&#39;t?) monetize&lt;br /&gt;
Some product concerns: attrition, engagement, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold off on monetization if:&lt;br /&gt;
Your product has strong network effects =&amp;gt; focus on getting a zillion users&lt;br /&gt;
AND&lt;br /&gt;
You can raise cheap capital&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monetization with advertising is very difficult. You need massive scale to matter to advertisers and merchants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware big-company biz dev deals. Big brands think of your startup as a toy: they will drop you in a heartbeat, often with dramatic consequences for the financial and emotional health of your startup...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bussgang&#39;s Parting Thoughts&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Entrepreneurship is about passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Failure and humility: part of life.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Happiness isn&#39;t a goal, it&#39;s a byproduct.&amp;quot; -- Eleanor Roosevelt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Balance and perspective: hard to maintain, pretty important.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Course summary? That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing all along...&lt;br /&gt;
Many of my classmates are way smarter than me: &lt;a href=&quot;http://launchingtechventures.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;http://launchingtechventures.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some key points/thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop specific, falsifiable hypotheses&lt;br /&gt;
Falsifiable: can be rejected via testing&lt;br /&gt;
Specific: &amp;quot;Viral coefficient &amp;gt; 0.4&amp;quot; NOT &amp;quot;Product will spread via WoM&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Measurable: quantitative measures (if possible)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MVP thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Reduce product functionality to test hypotheses =&amp;gt; MVP does necessarily mean a &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; product; sometimes just an incomplete product&lt;br /&gt;
-- Rely on temporary/makeshift measures =&amp;gt; Mechanical Turk, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Smoke tests (as appropriate)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Consider risk of false positives and false negatives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your startup&#39;s runway is the number of pivots you have left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On raising small amounts of capital:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Nothing focuses the mind like a hanging.&amp;quot; -- Samuel Johnson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s really hard to negotiate with big companies as a startup. Be careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools/techniques --- a laundry list&lt;br /&gt;
-- Customer discovery process&lt;br /&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Abnormal Earnings Model = one (sort of weird; non-traditional) way to value firms&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/equity-abnormal-earnings-equation.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/equity-abnormal-earnings-equation-300x97.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;equity-abnormal-earnings-equation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-- Should be &amp;quot;the same&amp;quot; as dividend discounting or DCF&lt;br /&gt;
-- Maybe better because provides better theory/economics behind price multiples&lt;br /&gt;
-- Implementation: less messy than other methods&lt;br /&gt;
=====&amp;gt; terminal value is usually a huge component of DCF; not that much better than just using multiples&lt;br /&gt;
=====&amp;gt; book value (as a minimum value of future cash flows) captures most of what would be terminal value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using accounting-based valuation&lt;br /&gt;
-- Price / Earnings =&amp;gt; measures what investors will pay for a dollar of earnings today (driven by growth prospects)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Price / Book Value =&amp;gt; measures (backward-looking) ability to generate sustainable, high ROE =&amp;gt; driven by both earnings growth and ROE (firm must be profitable)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Higher ROE today means lower P/E, all else being equal ===&amp;gt; turnarounds typically have high P/E ratio: low earnings today compared to what they &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; be&lt;br /&gt;
-- High leverage usually means high cost-of-equity (r) =&amp;gt; increased possibility of financial distress&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Cacophony of Voices: The Product Manager in B2B (LTV Blog Post #2)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/ltv/"/>
		<updated>2012-03-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/ltv/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product manager role is demanding and complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &amp;quot;The Product Manager,&amp;quot; Jeffrey Bussgang, Thomas Eisenmann, Robert Go&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/bidding.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/posts/ltv/images/bidding.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;bidding&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Our case mix in LTV was heavily weighted towards consumer Internet startups, with the expectation that the lessons we learned would be broadly generalizable across other business models and industries. I think this has been largely true, but I think product management in B2B firms offers several unique challenges and requires some different skills than are required in B2C. Our discussion of OPOWER touched on some of these challenges, which I believe mostly arise because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The User Isn&#39;t the Customer.&lt;/strong&gt; In the majority of our case discussions -- and in most B2C plays -- the person buying the product and the person using the product are either the same or closely aligned. This was true even for B2B ventures like RentJuice -- realtors who would actually use the product on a daily basis were the key decision-makers in RentJuice&#39;s selling process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the user is the customer, there is (at least in theory) a direct correlation between solving your users&#39; problems and selling your product. But in many B2B purchases, the Decision-Making Unit is larger and may lack perfect alignment about what features are desirable. Sometimes critical decision-maker will not actually use the product at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past summer, I was a product manager for a cloud-based medical records application. The app&#39;s primary users were doctors and nurses, who generally held very strong opinions about what features were desirable in a product they used for hours every day. They cared a great deal about qualities like design and ease of use. But the product was usually purchased by C-level executives at medical practices or hospitals, who cared far more about things like the cost of on-boarding new doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of these desires gets prioritized? And who is the real customer here -- the people who use the product or the people who decide to buy it? Balancing the needs of multiple constituencies can get even more complicated when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Customer Wants Conflicting Things.&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly different types of users desire different things from a product -- my former i-banker friend wants Excel to work as fast as possible with no visible user interface; I want Excel to walk me through creating pivot tables and most charts with a wizard. Excel can probably satisfy both of us by creating customizable preferences, which my i-banker friend can tweak appropriately. But sometimes different types of users want things are orthogonally opposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A startup founded by one of my friends launched a web-based timesheet application (think Kronos). He has continually encountered variants on a single tradeoff: hourly workers want a timesheet that is simple and quick to use, but accounting departments want a timesheet that is complex and detailed. My friend has done some really cool things with technology to try to make his product generate rich reporting with little input from hourly workers. But figuring out what ongoing improvements would be desirable frequently becomes a delicate balancing act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I don&#39;t think this challenge is unique to B2B -- we&#39;ve studied consumer-facing firms that managed several-sided markets or diverse sets of stakeholders (Rent the Runway and Mochi Media, for example). But I think the use cases/user stories in B2B products lend themselves to conflict and compromise far more often than in B2C settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason: businesses often &amp;quot;hire&amp;quot; software to mediate interactions between different internal functions/groups. If these groups were completely on the same page to begin with, they probably wouldn&#39;t need sophisticated software to manage their interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So What?&lt;/strong&gt; I think the upshot is that product managers in B2B settings face particular challenges in channeling the voice of the customer. I&#39;ve focused this post on enterprise software because it is an area of personal interest and familiarity, but I think similar problems arise for PMs in other technology-focused sectors. So how do PMs deal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Foster offered up one solution during our class on OPOWER. Although his firm sells its product to some of the largest and most regulation-bound businesses in America (utility companies), his product organization regards the end user -- consumers paying for electrical power -- as the customer. Ben asks the utilities who actually buy OPOWER to &amp;quot;allow us to focus on the consumer on your behalf.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben&#39;s methodology seems like a great fix -- basically turning OPOWER into a B2C firm for product management purposes and focusing on a single set of stakeholders. But this is not an approach that will work for every B2B firm. My friends&#39; timesheet app, for example, has two customer voices. He must listen to both, and incorporate features that some users don&#39;t want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ventures like his, I suspect the best solutions start with good customer discovery but require establishing organizational priorities around which users matter most and where the product can make compromises -- product principles, according to our note on product management. I think B2B startups will need such principles far earlier than B2C ventures, and their thoughtful articulation will be critical to the success of managing the product.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Valuation Lecture (BAV, Tuesday, Week 6)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/valuation-lecture-bav-tuesday-week-6/"/>

		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/valuation-lecture-bav-tuesday-week-6/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I hope you had enough coffee --- this is going to be awesome.&amp;quot; -- F. Brochet, before launching into lengthy discussion of valuation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional valuation methodologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures available cash flow to equity (dividends or repurchase): (Net Income) -- (Changes in Book Value of Net Op Assets) -- (Changes in Book Value of Net Debt)&lt;br /&gt;
Projects future performance (How far? Depends on maturity of firm...)&lt;br /&gt;
Terminal Value =&amp;gt; often 70 or 80% of firm&#39;s value&lt;br /&gt;
Discount rate =&amp;gt; sensitive to assumptions, basic CAPM should work but hard to find comps and several empirical challenges (size, book/market, momentum)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple; usually a good starting point&lt;br /&gt;
Need good judgment in selecting peer; usually hard to figure out &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; peers&lt;br /&gt;
Sensitive to non-recurring items, temporary performance blips, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
M&amp;amp;A premium --- how do we think about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternate methodology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Depends on semi-strong market efficiency (price reflects all publicly available data)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Rejects &amp;quot;greater fool theory&amp;quot; and industry-practice (everyone uses 12x EBITDA, so doing anything else actually imposes risk)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Fundamental problem with dividend discounting valuation methodologies --- namely, most public companies don&#39;t actually pay dividends!&lt;br /&gt;
-- Problem with DCF: capturing all flows is tricky, usually ends up being a more complicated version of multiples because terminal value is huge and hard to estimate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, assume that &amp;quot;abnormal earnings&amp;quot; (above equity cost of capital) will eventually revert to the mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still problems with abnormal earnings valuation: accounting data may need adjustment, off-balance sheet items not obvious, assumes &amp;quot;clean surplus&amp;quot; (where all changes in equity value flow through the income statement)&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Wright Brothers and Their Flying Machines (CMC, Thursday, Week 6)</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Big problems the Wright Brothers solved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power supply =&amp;gt; internal combustion engine, custom-built by them&lt;br /&gt;
Propulsion =&amp;gt; propellor, custom-built by them, derived from maritime turbine experiments&lt;br /&gt;
Stability =&amp;gt; invented control system (wing warping)&lt;br /&gt;
Air frame =&amp;gt; experimentally determined lift coefficients via self-built wind-tunnel, custom-built by them&lt;br /&gt;
Safety =&amp;gt; many early flight pioneers killed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incremental or radical innovation?&lt;br /&gt;
Not clear that powered flight was even possible; less clear that it would ever be profitable...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivations/methodology&lt;br /&gt;
-- Started with collaborative, &amp;quot;open source&amp;quot; model of discovery =&amp;gt; built on work by many others&lt;br /&gt;
-- Professed interest in science =&amp;gt; despite danger and lack of reward&lt;br /&gt;
-- Self-propelled QUEST&lt;br /&gt;
-- Did not participate in public contests. Why? Maybe shunned public glory, maybe fear of failure, maybe secrecy/patent protection...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Role of Chanute: visionary/supporter/catalyst OR ineffectual cheerleader?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsing their decision to patent --- in spite of &amp;quot;gentlemen&#39;s agreement&amp;quot; to share findings with the world&lt;br /&gt;
Reasons:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Take credit for invention&lt;br /&gt;
-- Value =&amp;gt; commercialize, spur competition&lt;br /&gt;
-- Reward for execution and risk-taking&lt;br /&gt;
-- Fund healthy innovation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But (maybe) abusive:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Takes rents from ALL flying machines =&amp;gt; American production of aircraft severely limited until government basically buys the Wright brothers out&lt;br /&gt;
-- Makes everyone take out patents --- probably not all patents are meaningful&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What was &amp;quot;scientific management?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
A complete mental revolution...&lt;br /&gt;
Timing/work study + incentives to perform =&amp;gt; spread across organization&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;first class&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;second class&amp;quot; employees =&amp;gt; lazy&lt;br /&gt;
Increasing the size of the pie, independent of how it gets divided (maybe...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor&#39;s goal: get rid of the foreman&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/scimgmt.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/scimgmt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;scimgmt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But lots of problems:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Foreman = advocate for workers, guardian of culture. Source of innovation (middle management produced M-Form in DuPont). Integrate new employees.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Who do workmen aspire to be? What does career progression look like?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Foreman = gatekeeper of information, source of quality control (when quality is not incredibly obvious)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Who supervises? Who settles disputes?&lt;br /&gt;
-- What replaces the foreman? Usually, unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairness problems.&lt;br /&gt;
Scientific management purports to increase the size of the pie without concern for how it gets divided. Early descriptions: labor keeps half of surplus.&lt;br /&gt;
But Schmidt example from Taylor&#39;s congressional testimony: output increases by 3.6x, wage to labor increases by 1.6x =&amp;gt; gains tend to go to capital&lt;br /&gt;
More broadly, we tend to specialize the &amp;quot;Planning Department&amp;quot; in things like management consulting practices --- outsiders and senior management capture tons of rent from any improvement in productivity...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this end?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/tayloroutcomes.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/tayloroutcomes-1024x772.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;tayloroutcomes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Game theory: Can we get to top-left quartile?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Empirically, tendency for management to extract as much surplus as possible (push towards top-right quartile). Management is usually concentrated; labor tends to be fragmented...&lt;br /&gt;
-- Backlash from labor: organize/unionize and push towards bottom-left quartile.&lt;/p&gt;

Marketing =&amp;gt; long-term perspective, not as measurable as sales&lt;br /&gt;
Customers =&amp;gt; utilities? consumers? Say one think, do another; don&#39;t always know what they really want.&lt;br /&gt;
CEO =&amp;gt; natural tendency to micro-manage (especially because he/she was probably product lead at the beginning...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Token system:&lt;br /&gt;
Allocate X% of development resources to sales requests to expedite/add new features.&lt;br /&gt;
Balance need for comprehensive product vision/independent roadmap with need to acquire customers NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaways (from Eric Paley):&lt;br /&gt;
-- Even after good product-market fit, scaling is a really hard problem.&lt;br /&gt;
-- The PM&#39;s goal = efficiently satisfying the true customer need, NOT the espoused customer need&lt;br /&gt;
-- PM has limited power; must find ways to build legitimacy and influence outcomes, SO:&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Develop rules that build trust but enforce tradeoffs&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Develop rules that reflect the values and strategy of the organization (token allocation: should reflect company&#39;s strategy)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Foster&#39;s comments:&lt;br /&gt;
-- A real product roadmap (independent of contractual commitments) = critical to building advantage/staying ahead of competitors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- PM&#39;s role: &amp;quot;to make the product successful on the market --- period.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Natural tension between developing good processes and necessary scrappiness/improvisation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Internal marketplace/token system: formalizes tradeoff between sales-driven development and product-driven development&lt;br /&gt;
If you don&#39;t have a long-term product vision, your competitors will leapfrog you...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Platform strategy: if you don&#39;t want to do a ton of customization, figure out how your customers can build on top of your product.&lt;br /&gt;
Can&#39;t say &amp;quot;We don&#39;t support this&amp;quot; --- Can say &amp;quot;We solve this in a generic way by making it possible for you to customize/build on top of our product&amp;quot; ==&amp;gt; future-proofing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- OPOWER&#39;s customer is the consumer, not the utility.&lt;br /&gt;
OPOWER: &amp;quot;Allow us to focus on the consumer on your behalf.&amp;quot; ==&amp;gt; lets firm be a thought-leader rather than totally reactive to individual utility requirements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Technical debt is a hard problem.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Strategy requires distilling your vision into something other than a 72-item list. You need priorities and sequencing.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You will never be really effective by minimizing your weaknesses.&amp;quot; -- Porter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did NYC become the leading metropolis in the US?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Great endowments =&amp;gt; natural harbor, halfway up East Coast, early trading hub, history of diversity/openness (NOT a Puritan colony)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Scale/critical mass&lt;br /&gt;
-- Quality of life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True prosperity comes from productive use of endowments, not just great endowments.&lt;br /&gt;
Country/region/city needs a distinctive positive identity that will inspire its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political will to implement policy choices = huge challenge.&lt;br /&gt;
Change takes a long time, and policy-makers need to be capable of lasting commitment, consistent direction, and endurance. Often a huge challenge --- election cycles are short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoning =&amp;gt; big lever for local government; lets you raise/lower density and preserve industrial spaces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge problem moving forward: Pension costs &amp;gt; salary costs for city workers&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Fred Wilson Q&amp;A (LTV, Tuesday, Week 6)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/fred-wilson-qa-ltv-tuesday-week-6/"/>
		<updated>2012-03-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/fred-wilson-qa-ltv-tuesday-week-6/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Competition sucks.&amp;quot; -- Seth Klarman, Baupost Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunch-driven vs. data-driven entrepreneurs: Fred Wilson funds both.&lt;br /&gt;
Caveat: hunch-driven entrepreneurs usually have a lot of domain experience ==&amp;gt; entrepreneur&#39;s hunch usually comes from an &amp;quot;obsessive-compulsive desire to solve a problem his own life&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure is usually more instructive than success.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We&#39;ve made more money backing entrepreneurs coming off of a failure than backing entrepreneurs coming off of a success.&amp;quot; -- Fred Wilson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virality is not always possible: needs to be some incentive for the user to get others onto the product.&lt;br /&gt;
(Comment: I don&#39;t think this is true. Hotmail virality was based on footer addendum to all e-mail messages [&amp;quot;This message was sent with Hotmail --- free web-based email&amp;quot; with a hyperlink].)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When to monetize: early vs. late&lt;br /&gt;
Monetize early if (1) it makes the user experience better or (2) you have a concrete, well-defined idea about how to monetize.&lt;br /&gt;
A common fallacy: Twitter took five years to monetize. Similar stories for Google, Facebook, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
BUT THEY ARE UNIQUE ANIMALS.&lt;br /&gt;
Your startup is not Twitter, and you will probably not be able to wait years and years before attempting to monetize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnerships/startup deals with big companies: mixed bag.&lt;br /&gt;
Frequently, big-company deals &amp;quot;take forever&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;suck the life out of a company.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Find ways to compete with gatekeepers.&lt;br /&gt;
How do you compete with HBS? Go right to the customer (students); avoid partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Fred Wilson likes angels and VC co-investment:&lt;br /&gt;
-- VCs have deep pockets and can scale the company. Angels usually can&#39;t help scale.&lt;br /&gt;
-- But angels, especially good ones, will go to bat for you no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MVP in a B2B startup: market demand.&lt;br /&gt;
People saying, &amp;quot;This product is a game-changer and I want to have a business relationship with it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: What kind of startup should you launch?&lt;br /&gt;
Answer: I&#39;m not positive, but NOT whatever is super-hot today.&lt;br /&gt;
Basic thesis =&amp;gt; Anything that CAN become end-to-end digital, but is not currently digital.&lt;br /&gt;
Internet models worked well in media and e-commerce. They will penetrate healthcare, education, financial services, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing on Airbnb:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I got caught up in the air mattress thing, and I couldn&#39;t get past it.&amp;quot; -- Fred Wilson&lt;br /&gt;
(Comment: I was very impressed by Fred Wilson&#39;s personal modesty/reluctance to make the sort of self-aggrandizing, judgmental pronouncements common among a certain sort of venture investors.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do something original. &amp;quot;I very much dislike copycats.&amp;quot; -- Fred Wilson&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New strategies require new organizational structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stages of American industry development (until mid-20th century):&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Product/technology innovation (railroads, discovery of oil, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
THEN&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Feeding frenzy/land grab (tons of small players)&lt;br /&gt;
THEN&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Ineffectual attempts to collude (cartels) =&amp;gt; extract rents&lt;br /&gt;
THEN&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Consolidation: Horizontal integration =&amp;gt; typically requires capital, professional management, innovation in organizational structure (centralized decision-making, accounting/control)&lt;br /&gt;
THEN&lt;br /&gt;
(5) Consolidation: Vertical integration =&amp;gt; requires more innovation in organizational structure&lt;br /&gt;
THEN&lt;br /&gt;
(6) Regulatory/populist backlash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monopolists&#39; double-bind: so you think you want a monopoly...&lt;br /&gt;
Firms want to consolidate to gain scale economies, control prices, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
BUT&lt;br /&gt;
Lean, differentiated firms deter competitors; attractive industries invite new entrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du Pont: the first multi-division firm --- dragged into it kicking and screaming by middle managers...&lt;br /&gt;
-- From one product-line (gunpowder) to many product-lines with manufacturing core competency.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Hard to measure performance? Devise the DuPont Formula...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du Pont&#39;s initial attempt to expand into multiple product-lines: should yield tons of economies of scale --- actually yields remarkable diseconomies of scale and zero customer focus.&lt;br /&gt;
Solution: multiple divisions (each division with its own marketing, sales, purchasing, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;
Counterintuitive because the firm gains efficiency by adding redundant departments and increasing &amp;quot;bureaucracy.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
And you need a ton of general managers (utility players, not specialists)...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Interesting to think about comparison with Rent the Runway. Both e-commerce, but many differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences/unique Chegg attributes:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Seasonality =&amp;gt; Chegg makes all its money from 2 three-week periods every year (academic calendar)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Digital future =&amp;gt; Print textbooks are probably not going to be around forever; (slowly) evaporating core business.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Chegg CVP = saving money on textbooks; RTR CVP = &amp;quot;Cinderella moments&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-- Customers have a finite lifespan (undergrads = four years of books) =&amp;gt; LTV is limited&lt;br /&gt;
-- Customers are REQUIRED to have textbooks (RTR = emotional choice)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonality between Chegg and RTR:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Teaching new customer behaviors is challenging. Need to articulate process very clearly...&lt;br /&gt;
-- Homogenous user base = easy chasm&lt;br /&gt;
-- Disruption! (Colin: maybe...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital-intensive startups are hard to manage. End up with a gazillion investors, often many different kinds of investors (angels, VCs, growth equity, etc.) with varied preferences, appetite for risk, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When J.D. Rockefeller&#39;s wealth peaked in 1912, he was worth $900M --- 2% of U.S. GDP.&lt;br /&gt;
He would&#39;ve been about five times as wealthy as Bill Gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humble beginnings: started off as a bookkeeper for a Cleveland produce shipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big accomplishment: takes oil from a land-grab business to a tightly-controlled empire.&lt;br /&gt;
Old industry (ca. 1860) = no production controls, no experts, no regulation, low barriers to entry, huge boom/bust cycles to due variability in production (bad incentives), short-lived cartels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard empire (ca. 1878) = ridiculous economies of scale, skilled managerial team, consolidation both upstream and downstream, order to chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1863 == Standard oil marketshare = 0%&lt;br /&gt;
1872 == Standard oil marketshare = 25%&lt;br /&gt;
1878 == Standard oil marketshare = 90%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it brains or luck?&lt;br /&gt;
Or, &amp;quot;Was it inevitable that someone would horizontally and vertically consolidate the oil business, or was Rockefeller&#39;s success due to a series of brilliant strategic decisions?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Probably some of both.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Dutch flower auctions are ridiculous feats of human ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flower growers own the auction houses = really, really smart.&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Price discovery, feedback on products, visibility into customer decision-making.&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Enables survival even after economics make it unfavorable to grow certain flowers in Netherlands...because now the Dutch can export services, expertise, maintain auction as hub, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although obviously a great example of a successful cluster, I am less sure about any real take-aways.&lt;br /&gt;
First-mover seemed to matter a lot. Government did not appear to be very active in cluster development --- if anything, Dutch gov&#39;t seems driven by interests/desires of large players in cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems hard for governments to actually do anything to encourage cluster formation, and much harder to figure out how they should spur cluster development. Picking winners is probably not the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What is financial analysis?&lt;br /&gt;
Identify key drivers of performance =&amp;gt; assess past/present performance =&amp;gt; determine whether firm is achieving its goals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starts with understanding firm strategy (business model, risks, unique characteristics, competitors, lifecycle) and accounting choices.&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; If accounting choices do not reflect objectives/risks, maybe we should adjust to capture reality &amp;quot;better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other hints for ratio analysis:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Be careful about changes in firm&#39;s operations over time --- one-time items, new strategies, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Cross-sectional analysis (firm vs. competitors) --- Do firms in the same industry have the same strategy? Sometimes, but often not...&lt;br /&gt;
-- Some items are often troublesome/hard to &amp;quot;bucket&amp;quot; (convertible securities on B/S, deferred taxes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts on commodity firms&lt;br /&gt;
-- Need to understand/scrutinize cyclicality and utilization =&amp;gt; central to valuation&lt;br /&gt;
-- Often huge changes in revenue without much change in assets&lt;br /&gt;
-- Macro perspective/factors = usually significant&lt;br /&gt;
-- Non-obvious insight: Commodity producers can do great when input prices rise IF demand is strong and supply/capacity is tight. Pass factor price increases on to customers...&lt;/p&gt;

Otherwise...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-way network: need to balance attention to advertisers, publishers, and game developers.&lt;br /&gt;
Really, really hard...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alignment&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Mochi probably shouldn&#39;t have taken funding from big-fund VCs (Accel). How can this model scale? Did they really want it to?&lt;br /&gt;
It doesn&#39;t seem like it.&lt;br /&gt;
Obviously, it&#39;s hard to turn down big-name venture investors...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s dangerous to scale before you&#39;ve nailed the business model.&lt;br /&gt;

==&amp;gt; Mess up culture.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus: Thoughts from Jeff Bussgang (or, &amp;quot;thoughts on Lean Startups from the king of the fat start-up&amp;quot;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-- Winning the market is the goal. Lean Startup is just a methodology. There are no bonus points for &amp;quot;running lean.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-- There are some situations where fat makes a lot of sense =&amp;gt; cash is a weapon in tough times, raising money is easier when you don&#39;t need it, aiming high is how you build a great company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONFIDENCE INSPIRES CAPITAL, CAPITAL INSPIRES CONFIDENCE.&lt;br /&gt;
When you raise a big round, people start believing in the venture. You can attract great people, you can woo big-name partners, etc. =&amp;gt; virtuous cycle =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Dance of the Dreamweaver&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starts as small-scale railroad speculator, consolidates previously-disparate lines into large road networks.&lt;br /&gt;
Villain: no attempt to run his own enterprises efficiently, breaks securities law, spurs over-investment in capacity.&lt;br /&gt;
Hero: realizes the value of traffic, creates competition that benefits the consumer, compels railroads to consolidate rather than rely on cartel agreements, forces managerial capitalism (Vanderbilt family wealth alone cannot support necessary expansion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we deal with railroads (natural monopoly; common goods; kind of like public utilities)? Options:\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Promote public benefit&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; BUT will new investors take the risk of construction? And we hate big federal government (especially in 19th century).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government construction/operation&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Is the government really smarter/better at management than the private sector? Ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-regulation (collusion)&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Not efficient&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Natural tendency towards cheating; agreements are not really enforceable&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fink proposal: legalize collusion; build legal enforcement mechanism for price-fixing agreements&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Is this better than regulation or government operation? I don&#39;t like government-protected barons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pure silver cup gifted to George F. Baker (head of First National Bank) for his 80th birthday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source of power: Morgan &amp;quot;brands&amp;quot; money (with his personal and professional reputation)...and it makes government distinctly uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Money Trust Investigations: Most American wealth at the start of the 20th century lies in the hands of 180 men working for five banks. No railroad or corporation could realistically shift its business from one bank to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge banking syndicates &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; many of the natural monopoly problems for railroads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morganization:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Reorganize =&amp;gt; lower fixed costs by altering debt covenants&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Convert debt to equity =&amp;gt; easier to raise capital, spread out ownership, no interest payments&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Stop downward pressure on prices =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;communities of interest&amp;quot; = a fancy word for cartels&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Personal investment by finance tycoons =&amp;gt; lend aura of stability/certainty&lt;br /&gt;
(5) Take board seats =&amp;gt; interlocking ownership of roads = economic disincentive to cheat on price-fixing agreements&lt;br /&gt;
(6) Trusts =&amp;gt; faster decisions, influence by proxy&lt;br /&gt;
===&amp;gt; Forerunner of modern Chaper 11 reorganization (long-term perspective, DIP financing, wipe out equity holders/give firm to creditors, streamline decision-making)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan = central bank powers lie in a single man&lt;br /&gt;
Pros: seems to work pretty well in crisis (Panic of 1907)&lt;br /&gt;
Cons: frontpage NY Times story when JPM catches a cold (consolidated risk), is JPM a benevolent autocrat or a calculating, self-interested tycoon?&lt;br /&gt;
Evidence on both sides; Morgan&#39;s bank ends up with millions in fees and 14% of equity for advising International Harvester re-org --- doesn&#39;t seem like arm&#39;s length capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

=&amp;gt; Cheap labor, stable government&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Responsive national leadership (brutal truth)&lt;br /&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Financial analysis challenge: separate operating effects from financing effects.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, I never want to be an equity research analyst (even though this class is actually pretty interesting)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FedEx =&amp;gt; All operating leases, reduces net income a little but dramatically understates size of total asset base ($8B in &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; assets). On the other hand, impact on ROE is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;
Why capital leases make sense: conservative/accurate approach to leverage and firm&#39;s ability to take on debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-time events sometimes swamp &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; performance&lt;br /&gt;
-- UPS strike kills profitability in one FY&lt;br /&gt;
-- FedEx acquisition of RPS dramatically changes cost structure in another FY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condensing the income statement: four key metrics&lt;br /&gt;
-- Sales&lt;br /&gt;
-- Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT) = Net Income + Net Interest Expense (after taxes)&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Earnings on Net Operating Assets; driven by sales growth&lt;br /&gt;
-- Net Interest Expense After Taxes = (Interest Expense -- Interest Income) x (1 -- Tax Rate)&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; After-tax cost of Net Debt; driven by leverage and financing costs&lt;br /&gt;
-- Net Income&lt;br /&gt;
======&amp;gt; Separates operating net income from effects of capital structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condensing the balance sheet: four key components&lt;br /&gt;
Total Net Operating Assets&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Net Working Capital =&amp;gt; minimal economies of scale&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Net Long-Term Assets =&amp;gt; potential economies of scale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Capital (financing)&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Net Debt (interest bearing) =&amp;gt; drives interest expense&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Equity =&amp;gt; residual claim on earnings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- It is really easy to get lazy about testing assumptions. It&#39;s one thing to say that you&#39;re Lean, but nobody actually wants to get proven wrong...&lt;br /&gt;
-- Expose yourself and your plan to ridicule.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Benefits of explaining your business model from a blank sheet of paper =&amp;gt; surfaces implicit assumptions; useful even if you are convinced that your unique insight (ha-ha) is correct.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Facts exist outside the building =&amp;gt; I already believed it, but speculating about a business model for two hours makes it so much more obvious.&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;My hypothesis can&#39;t be tested&amp;quot; is always wrong. It might take more creativity than Google AdWords.&lt;br /&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cluster: a geographically proximate group of interconnected companies and associated institutions in a particular field, linked by commonalities and complementarities&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Big deal: positive externalities associated with geography:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Drive increased productivity/operating efficiency (efficient access to specialized inputs, ease of coordination across firms, rapid diffusion of best practices, proximate rivals encourage differentiation)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Stimulate innovation (ease of experimentation, density eases recognition of unmet needs)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Facilitate new business formation (opportunities are apparent, concentrated demand encourages spinoffs, commercializing new products is easier)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So I really want competitors nearby??&amp;quot; Porter argues yes.&lt;br /&gt;
-- More competition more opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Lose employees to spinoffs expanding supply of skilled people&lt;br /&gt;
-- Bid up costs larger local supplier base, increased flexibility/efficiency&lt;br /&gt;
Most cluster participants are NOT direct competitors, firms end up differentiated.&lt;br /&gt;
Not sure I buy it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why French wine cluster is stagnant:&lt;br /&gt;
Inflexible government policies; protectionism =&amp;gt; tons of fragmented little wineries; no incentive to innovate; stuck in the past/present&lt;br /&gt;
Beware when industries are considered a &amp;quot;national treasure&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Amazon in late 2000: expanding like crazy, minority stakes in many startups (&lt;a href=&quot;http://pets.com/&quot;&gt;pets.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drugstore.com/&quot;&gt;drugstore.com&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), extremely hard to tell whether they&#39;re a doomed tech shell game or a sly game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravi Suria: Increasing competition (B&amp;amp;N, Borders), negative FCF, out of cash in the next six months and unable to service debt.&lt;br /&gt;
Amazon: No way.&lt;br /&gt;
Broader context =&amp;gt; Post-bubble burst, tension between equity and credit analysts, potential incentive to write contrarian reports. All of Suria&#39;s research uses publicly-available information...so why does stock price plunge 15% after report&#39;s release?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessing progress via financial statements is really hard if a firm is growing rapidly. Especially with operating leases and aggressive goodwill amortization (not really an issue anymore...).\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One argument: you could just look at Amazon&#39;s operating metrics. LTV &amp;gt; CAC. BUT Amazon is trying to change customer behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
Fundamental thesis = customer service and satisfaction will differentiate Amazon; e-commerce will not spur ruthless competition on price alone. Obviously true in hindsight; not at all obvious at the time. Secular hypotheses are hard to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about seasonality: Suria extrapolates AMZN&#39;s drop in payables post-Christmas forward to the whole year. Doesn&#39;t make sense; AMZN is paying merchants for XMas wares. The machine is built around negative NWC --- growth generates cash.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The dark side of American capitalism, part 2...&lt;br /&gt;
Enduring issues about how you construct a new nation --- clearly, Native Americans have a legitimate claim to the land. Federal seizure of land constitutes grave injustice and violates principles of American revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; Echoes of Jefferson vs. Hamilton: Is the role of government to facilitate the most economic prosperity for the most people, at any reasonable cost?&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Popular opinion: heavily in favor of seizure. Can politicians really oppose this? Is this a problem for American representative democracy?&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Can a group of disparate bronze-age cultures survive as a &amp;quot;state within a state&amp;quot; adjacent to a bustling, expanding mercantile power? This has almost never worked out well --- failure to intervene invites future violence and discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; Similarities to &amp;quot;eminent domain&amp;quot; --- we generally support the right of government to build a highway through private land, regardless of whether property owners want to sell. But Native-American removal isn&#39;t really the same: displacing tribes to build farms and towns, not public goods like roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; Backdrop of Manifest Destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; Northerners generally less sympathetic to Indian Removal Act. But the Mohegan, Narragansett, and Delaware tribes are already extinct by 1830. Would northern states exist without previous injustices visited upon natives who held claim to land?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few satisfying answers about how capitalist nations can fairly interact with fundamentally non-capitalist societies.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Railroads and the Beginnings of Modern Management (CMC, Friday, Week 3)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/friday-week-3-2/"/>
		<updated>2012-02-10T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First huge-scale corporations in America: railroads. First railroads borrowed org structure heavily from the Napoleanic General Staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1800: ~0 mi. =&amp;gt; NYC to Chicago = 6 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1830: 23 mi. =&amp;gt; NYC to Chicago = 3 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1850: 9,000 mi. =&amp;gt; NYC to Chicago = 1.5 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1870: 53,000 mi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1890: 130,000 mi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massively larger than textile mills.&lt;br /&gt;
Erie Railroad = $2.5M in OpEx/year and 4,000 employees&lt;br /&gt;
Pepperell Manufacturing (textile giant) = $300K in OpEx/year and 800 employees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large enterprise and geographic distance require:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Data management and analysis&lt;br /&gt;
-- Understanding of costs (and drivers of cost)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Division of responsibilities&lt;br /&gt;
-- Organizational learning mechanisms&lt;br /&gt;
In early years, railroads experienced DIS-economies of scale --- management practice (and, to a lesser degree, technology) had not caught up with the complexity of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New questions about relationship between business and government&lt;br /&gt;
-- Should railroads be public institutions? Massive scale...&lt;br /&gt;
-- Land grants =&amp;gt; builders get checkerboard-style parcels of the land adjacent to the road IOT incentivize construction.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Free use of railroads by federal government (Lincoln implemented initial grant policy to help Union in Civil War)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Tariffs (Interstate Commerce Act) =&amp;gt; railroads are the first truly national-level businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind-boggling complex businesses require specialized managers: continued divorce of ownership from management/enterprise control (from whence &amp;quot;The Coming of Managerial Capitalism&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early roads (1855)&lt;br /&gt;
Centralized control: one General Supervisor with 13 direct reports&lt;br /&gt;
BUT continued problems with maintaining adequate supervision AND direct-reports are interdependent --- not independent --- entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later roads (1890)&lt;br /&gt;
Matrix organizations: President, several Vice Presidents, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
Need to grow? Just add a layer... =&amp;gt; homogenize and scale&lt;br /&gt;
Maximum span of control for one general supervisor = 500 mi.&lt;br /&gt;
Direct and indirect reports (supervisors get their own engineers, supply agents, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting innovation:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Fixed vs. variable costs =&amp;gt; some costs vary with length of road; some costs vary with number of trains&lt;br /&gt;
-- Understanding profitability =&amp;gt; variable pricing&lt;br /&gt;
-- Direct connection between accounting and everyday business tactics/strategic decision-making&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitalism and exploitation: Chinese immigrants did most construction on railroads; U.S. deported them at close of 19th century when roads were complete.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Are We There Yet: Thinking Through Product/Market Fit (LTV, Blog Post #1)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/are-we-there-yet-thinking-through-productmarket-fit-ltv/"/>
		<updated>2012-02-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/are-we-there-yet-thinking-through-productmarket-fit-ltv/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/Are-We-There-Yet.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/Are-We-There-Yet-300x221.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Are-We-There-Yet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Startups occasionally ask me to help them evaluate whether they have achieved product/market fit. It&#39;s easy to answer: if you are asking, you&#39;re not there yet.&amp;quot; -- Eric Ries, &amp;quot;The Lean Startup&amp;quot; (pg 220)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship --- epitomized by Eric Ries&#39; Lean Startup methodology --- has become all the rage among aspiring tech founders. It&#39;s not hard to see why. Ries&#39; focus on customer discovery and iterative development addresses a dangerous problem in the two established paradigms for building software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterfall product development presumes that the problem and the solution are known, and we just have to build the solution in an efficient, staged manner. Agile product development admits that the solution is unknown, but still presumes that the problem is known --- the &amp;quot;voice of the customer&amp;quot; (usually the product manager) will recognize useful software when she sees it. But actually, Lean Startup tells us, the problem is usually unknown, too: it takes ingenuity, guts, and contact with customers &lt;shudder&gt; to determine whether software is useful or not.&lt;/shudder&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Okay, so we admit that we&#39;re in the land of the blind, and we need to be disciplined and systematic about figuring out what problem we should be solving. But how do we know when we&#39;ve got the right problem paired with the right solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ries tells us that the watershed condition is product/market fit --- we&#39;ve looped through the Build-Measure-Learn process, improving all the while, until we&#39;ve built an &amp;quot;engine of growth&amp;quot; (by which Eric appears to mean a product with rapidly accelerating user acquisition). Then, we just add fuel and watch the engine go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that a whole bunch of phenomenally successful and (purportedly) Lean startups slowed down rapid product development iteration --- basically, decided that the product was mostly done --- well before they had anything resembling an engine of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The lack of rigor around what constitutes product/market fit makes successfully applying Lean methodology much harder. One of our class guests, David Skok, has written brilliant expositions on constructing a repeatable, scalable sales model. He opened our class discussion with a graphic (roughly):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/skok1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/skok1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;skok&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, my business only has product/market fit if I already have a sustainable user acquisition model --- ideally an engine of growth so powerful that just a small quantity of &amp;quot;fuel&amp;quot; causes users to crash my webservers and beat down the front door to my startup&#39;s office in desperate mad dash to consume my product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it seems to me that my venture has probably already figured out the marketing and sales part of the equation if that is occurring.&lt;br /&gt;
And many (if not most) successful startups do appear to delineate building a product from building a sales model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two examples in brief (one cribbed from David Skok):&lt;br /&gt;
-- Airbnb enters YCombinator with a product they have already trialled at SXSW and the Democratic National Convention. They expect to do a ton of development in YC. Paul Graham tells the founders to stop building product, hop a plane to New York City (where they have the most adoption), and personally snap prettier photos of the apartments currently listed on Airbnb.&lt;br /&gt;
Scalable? No way.&lt;br /&gt;
Did the market tell them to do this? Nope (at least I don&#39;t think so).&lt;br /&gt;
Did it work? Yes. Prospective renters and couch-surfers had been turned off by ugly descriptions of the listed apartments. Success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Constant Contact completes product development (in the words of David Skok, has found product/market fit). But prospective customers aren&#39;t buying.&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, prospective customers (small businesses in Atlanta) aren&#39;t sure why they would need mass-mailing software in the first place. Constant Contact distributes wire-bound books for small businesses to use as visitor books to record shoppers&#39; e-mail addresses.&lt;br /&gt;
A month later, Constant Contact&#39;s prospective customers have hundreds of e-mail addresses, and now they need mass-mailing software. Success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can tell similar stories for startups like JBoss, RentJuice, and Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I don&#39;t think David is wrong in making a distinction in the startup lifecycle between product development and marketing/sales. I think Lean Startup makes it difficult to tell when to stop focusing primarily on building product and start focusing primarily on selling product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One possibility (maybe what Eric would argue) is that I&#39;ve defined the &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; part of &amp;quot;product/market fit&amp;quot; too narrowly. The product is not just a piece of software but rather the startup as a whole --- a product-marketing-sales-PR conglomeration that must be tuned and operating in harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not so sure. There is a natural tension between Lean-style product development and marketing/sales.&lt;br /&gt;
In Lean product development, we tirelessly labor to determine what the customer will use and then build something viable and desirable. If the customer tells us (by his or her behavior) that a feature should be different, we change. We pull the product out of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sales and marketing, we tirelessly labor to convince the customer that they should use or buy what we already have. If the customer tells us that a feature should be different, we generally try to convince him or her that we know better. We push the product onto the market. And ideally, the customer doesn&#39;t require much convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lean Startup methodology needs a better definition of product/market fit than &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it&quot;&gt;I know it when I see it&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; Maybe arbitrary standards like 40% net promoter score make the most sense. Perhaps we just admit that user acquisition growth is not the right metric for many startups, especially those that require higher-touch sales models. Regardless, I think we need to take a deeper look at what goal we&#39;re actually chasing if we&#39;re running lean.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Feudalism (socialism) or unbridled capitalism?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Is American capitalism indelibly rooted in tragic inhumanity?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Or was slavery mostly a social phenomenon that probably even hurt economic progress? Heat map of slave ownership in the U.S. in mid-19th century is, to this day, a mirror image of the most impoverished areas of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demographics of slavery&lt;br /&gt;
-- Existed in the north, but one-third of southern population in 1860 was slave.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Most slaves (esp before 1810) transported to Brazil and Caribbean, not U.S.&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Gone with the Wind&amp;quot;-style plantations were the exception. Mostly smaller-scale operations; only 385K slaveowners of 8.3M whites in slave states (~4.5%).&lt;br /&gt;
-- In economic terms, labor treated as a capital good. Market price for slaves (before puberty, girls worth more; after puberty, boys worth more); some of the roots of accrual accounting are in keeping track of slaves.&lt;br /&gt;
-- White life expectancy in America (1850): 40 years. Slave life expectancy (1850): 36 years. Life expectancy in Italy (1885): 35 years. Life expectancy in NYC/Boston/Philadelphia (1830): 24 years. ==&amp;gt;&amp;gt; slaves as assets, value in maximizing productive lifespan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern economic impact:&lt;br /&gt;
Largest slave port in the country at turn of 19th century: Newport, RI&lt;br /&gt;
Northern shipping and textile manufacturing =&amp;gt; dependent on slavery for cheap cotton&lt;/p&gt;

Phase 2 = Seed (&amp;lt;$1M) 5-6 ppl. 3-4 engineers, 1 product/frontend, 1 biz generalist burn = 600K/yr Legal fees on 700K will be 20-30K. Unit economics matter more than forecasts when raising A; everyone says they&#39;ll be huge. Mint&#39;s Projections from Lead-Gen &amp;amp; CPA during seed pitches = exactly right; even now. $30/user/year. Build up your pitch from chronological sequence of what a user does on your site. Phase 3 = Series A (&amp;gt;$1M)&lt;br /&gt;
Burn = $6M/year&lt;br /&gt;
Need to be profitable within 2 years (or at least not growing too fast)&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Critical elements of Porter&#39;s diamond model (gross generalization):&lt;br /&gt;
-- Demand conditions (quality of demand, not quantity of demand) =&amp;gt; dramatically under-appreciated, usually most important&lt;br /&gt;
-- Related and supporting industries =&amp;gt; close second&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; in economic policy: everyone agrees on overall direction even if they disagree on the particulars of how to get there&lt;br /&gt;
Example: Estonia (lots of political infighting; general consensus which way the ship should go)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success in macro = solving political, economic, and social equations all at the same time&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Often tough because developing countries usually get more unequal as they get richer. Challenge: maintaining political stability in the face of inequality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice things about small countries:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Can&#39;t do everything; forced to specialize (i.e. pick what NOT to do)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Usually easier to make changes&lt;br /&gt;
-- Usually less temptation to build huge governments (pretty obvious that having a super-complex tax policy that requires tons of people to enforce is a non-starter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estonia: never bought into the &amp;quot;myth of Communism&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-- Always got Finnish TV stations. Grocery-store commercials with cuts of red meat, dairy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualifying for EU membership: Slowly replacing every bone in a country&#39;s body. Usually for the better, but takes time and strains government.&lt;/p&gt;

Example: you could test whether 40-55 y/o males will share their investment decisions by running a three-month public portfolio management contest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s really easy to say &amp;quot;test hypotheses rigorously&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;assume nothing.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s a lot harder to do in practice, and there are sometimes false positives and false negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR and snazzy launches: sometimes appropriate, sometimes not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good idea doesn&#39;t necessarily make a great business. =&amp;gt; Steve&#39;s example: renting zoo animals for birthday parties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biz dev is dead (at least for the consumer web) =&amp;gt; you don&#39;t need it to get scale anymore (and if you do, you probably have the wrong idea)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog/do other things to build personal credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economics of being a founder at a startup (as opposed to an early hire) are phenomenal. For 6-10 months of additional risk, founder gets tremendous upside.&lt;/p&gt;

-- Might move too slowly to capture a market opportunity (if it&#39;s winner-take-all)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think today&#39;s arguments about IP protection/patent enforcement are new and different, you are totally wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Constant tension between jump-starting an industry/diffusion of tech/prosperity for the masses vs. protecting innovation/incentivizing discovery&lt;br /&gt;
-- People talking about patenting algorithms (for designing manufacturing set-ups) in the early 19th century&lt;br /&gt;
-- Conflict between developed countries (England) and developing (America) over IP rights against backdrop of global competitiveness/nationalism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close relationship between production and marketing/sales is relatively new.&lt;br /&gt;
Prior to Lowell company, manufacturers just produced a ton of cloth without regard for demand.\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think it might be a sign of the apocalypse when Occupy Wall Street is the target market for an HBS student startup.&amp;quot; -- Jeff Bussgang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you have product/market fit, you still have to develop a repeatable and scalable sales model.&lt;br /&gt;
This is hard, because lots of sales models don&#39;t really scale --- SEM often doesn&#39;t, because there are only so many keywords and quality of results often declines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key element: CAC (or COCA) &amp;lt; LTV&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/cacltv.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/cacltv-300x127.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;cacltv&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Source: David Skok&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact of sales complexity: it really sucks.&lt;br /&gt;
Freemium &amp;gt;&amp;gt; No touch self-service &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Light-touch inside sales &amp;gt;&amp;gt; High-touch inside sales &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Field sales &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Field sales w/ Sales engineers&lt;br /&gt;
Each additional level of complexity increases CAC by a factor of 10!&lt;br /&gt;
More detail here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/sales-complexity/&quot;&gt;http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/sales-complexity/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Solution: Try to change your product to minimize sales complexity. Can you demo on the web?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rule of thumb: sales guy needs to produce about 6x his/her salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit down with a blank sheet of paper and draw a diagram of your sales funnel. Put it on the wall in your office. Figure out where your blockage points are. Every week (or whatever), sit down with sales and marketing and discuss how you fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get your customers to self-identify into personas. Examples: newbie tech-user OR marketer OR engineer. Customize product/demo/pitch based on that in order to avoid customer confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall takeaway:&lt;br /&gt;
Marketing and sales are not black arts. Marketing and sales are predictable, scalable, measurable activities. Treat them as such.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How banks work:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Very asset intensive (huge balance sheet)&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Interest spread&amp;quot; model flows through balance sheet and income statement&lt;br /&gt;
-- Manage income statement for investors; manage balance sheet for regulators (esp. in a crisis). Natural tension...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implications of fair-value accounting --- three kinds of assets:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Held to maturity: held at historical cost, amortized, subject to impairment checks&lt;br /&gt;
-- Available for sale: held at fair value, any changes hit the balance sheet as &amp;quot;other comprehensive income&amp;quot; ==&amp;gt; Why? Because if your house doubles in value in a year ($200K to $400K), you didn&#39;t really earn $200K more income that year.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Trading Assets: held at fair value, any changes flow through income statement ==&amp;gt; Why? Because if your job is flipping real estate, you actually did earn $200K of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three ways to assess fair value of assets (in order of increasing subjectivity):&lt;br /&gt;
Level 1: unadjusted market price (equity in GE)&lt;br /&gt;
Level 2: mark to model, disciplined by market input (some unique GE corporate bond; not exactly like traded securities but pretty close)&lt;br /&gt;
Level 3: mark to model, unobservable inputs (claim on GE&#39;s future earnings from one particular project; no clear analogues)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some managerial discretion in deciding which method to apply. Be wary if lots of assets valued via Level 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory requirements --- several ratios, big-picture takeaway:&lt;br /&gt;
Numerator = most kinds of equity (net of intangible assets and goodwill)&lt;br /&gt;
Denominator = risk-adjusted assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do banks get through crises:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Sell assets (problem: prices are usually bad)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Raise capital (problem: usually especially costly)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Cosmetics (sell appreciated assets and immediately replace them; re-classify; etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Firms have embraced operational effectiveness at the expense of strategy. Both are important.\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operational effectiveness: doing activities better than your rivals&lt;br /&gt;
Strategy: doing different activities than your rivals&lt;br /&gt;
One of these can be easily copied (OE), one provides a sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Careful choice of firm activities creates tradeoffs that prevent easy copying because:&lt;br /&gt;
-- some activities are incompatible&lt;br /&gt;
-- firms need a consistent image/reputation (can&#39;t be both the quality leader and the cost leader)&lt;br /&gt;
-- limits on internal coordination (can&#39;t run both a high-touch and a low-touch sales force)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a national level, comparative advantage (a la Ricardo and Adam Smith) is flawed because choice of industries CREATES relevant factors of production. If you choose to produce wine, your nation makes sustained investment in capacity and creates specialized factors of production --- so you get better at making wine and not better at making cloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cluster theory of business environment --- competitiveness in an industry requires:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Context for firm strategy and rivalry (competition between firms)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Factor [Input] Conditions (access to high-quality inputs)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Demand Conditions (sophisticated and demanding local consumers)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Related and Supporting Industries (available suppliers and supporting industries)&lt;/p&gt;

-- Use the matching principal as a general guide, but also think about the relative size of the asset. If half of your balance sheet is capitalized marketing, people will start asking questions.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Can be a challenge for rapidly-growing firms --- lots of growth + aggressive capitalization = tends to overstates profitability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All assets have uncertain future benefits (cash due to inflation, receivables due to bad debt, tangible assets due to uncertainty of future cash flows)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Trade-off between relevance and reliability&lt;br /&gt;
-- Think about fair value (and possibility of a big impairment), think about timeline for depreciation/amortization&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really hard to develop an MVP for products with strong network effects (i.e. dating websites, two-sided markets, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that your ability to run experiments drives the pace of your development, it&#39;s hard to move fast without a bunch of customers. How many A/B tests can you do with 100 users?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hide crappy users to boost perceived user quality (hi Quora).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get one round of good PR when you raise money. Use it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunil Nagaraj on Facebook platform:&lt;br /&gt;
-- By the time you hear about a new feature on Facebook and you think you&#39;re early in exploiting it, you are already too late.&lt;br /&gt;
-- The only people who seem to win on Facebook apps are those who read Terms of Service incredibly closely --- and then do exploit them by toeing the line of what is permissible.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Performance Pay Plan at Safelite (MONV, Thursday, Week 1)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/thursday-week-1/"/>
		<updated>2012-01-27T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Incentive systems: formal and informal rules that determine how value creation and destruction are allocated to members of an organization, which affects the amount of value created or destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;
Key point: how you divide the pie actually influences the size of the pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two key considerations in designing compensation systems: motivation and selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competing schools of thought on what motivates people &amp;gt;&amp;gt; extrinsic vs. intrinsic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extrinsic (Classic economist perspective)&lt;br /&gt;
-- $$$ = motivation&lt;br /&gt;
-- People mostly look out for themselves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic (Dan Pink&#39;s &amp;quot;Drive&amp;quot; and lots of experimental research)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Autonomy, mastery, purpose&lt;br /&gt;
-- Need a base level of extrinsic reward. Above the base level, material rewards actually decrease performance. Ergo, pay people enough so that &amp;quot;money is not an issue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try telling people that you&#39;re going to build a business around many smart, educated people working super-hard on something with no obvious material compensation. It sounds stupid.&lt;br /&gt;
But: Wikipedia, Apache, Linux, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlassian Software = good case study. One free day per quarter to work on whatever; only rule is that you need to share your work the following day. Produced more good ideas and quashed more bugs than organized projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaway: When the &amp;quot;profit motive&amp;quot; gets unmoored from the &amp;quot;purpose motive,&amp;quot; bad things happen.&lt;br /&gt;
Unethical behavior, poor customer service, trouble recruiting and retaining employees, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Purchase: possibly the best real estate deal in the history of the world&lt;br /&gt;
$10M for New Orleans + $5M for Louisiana Territory + ~$7M for extras = $22M ($450M in today&#39;s dollars)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Astor go from penniless to the tycoon of his era?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Organized; great talent manager (equity compensation for employees; management techniques that were hundreds of years ahead of his time)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Capital at a time when it was scarce&lt;br /&gt;
-- Close connection to U.S. government&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;World without rules&amp;quot; (climate of the time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fur =&amp;gt; merchant trading =&amp;gt; real estate/infrastructure&lt;br /&gt;
Consistent radical innovation that changed industry structure: built monopolies and then destroyed monopolies.&lt;br /&gt;
See also: Schumpeter on creative destruction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his life, Astor&#39;s workday ended at 2pm. His net worth grew at about 50% CAGR for 48 years. What have you done lately, and how hard are you working?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing merchant ships on four-year voyages:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Get the best captains in the world&lt;br /&gt;
-- Give captains a stake in the venture&lt;br /&gt;
-- Give captains some guidance; trust their decision-making&lt;br /&gt;
-- Make sure captains have a wife and kids at home (so they don&#39;t run away with your merchandise)&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Bausch &amp; Lomb/Revenue Recognition (BAV, Wednesday, Week 1)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/wednesday-week-1/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of accounting fraud involves revenue recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do companies play games with earnings? Duh, yes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/revenues.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/revenues-300x185.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;revenues&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentives to game:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Meeting/beating analysts&#39; expectations pays off in share price, especially for &amp;quot;habitual beaters&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-- Markets reacts poorly to revenue surprises (especially for growth firms)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Resource allocation within firm&lt;br /&gt;
-- Personal compensation, promotion, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: When do we recognize revenue? (first-year review)&lt;br /&gt;
A: When it is (1) realized/realizable and (2) earned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning signs for revenue recognition games:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Increase in days receivable&lt;br /&gt;
-- Long-term loans to customers (why are they happening?) or sales on consignment&lt;br /&gt;
-- Transactions that are not actually arm&#39;s length (i.e. Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb took returns of contact lenses, even though they said they wouldn&#39;t)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Barter transactions or other transactions with lots of judgment involved (multiple deliverables, customer acceptance provisions, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Management under pressure to meet targets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior management at Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb not convicted of fraud, but still guilty of creating an environment that encouraged fraud and failing to implement sufficient controls against fraud. Gulf between &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; company policy and side deals some employees made with distributors to permit returns, subsidize storage post-sale, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Echoes of Jefferson/Madison (fairness/equity) vs. Hamilton (prosperity) debate resonate in TARP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamilton&#39;s Plan:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Consolidation of state debts (Delaware = $50K, Mass = $5M =&amp;gt; fair?)&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Repay current debt holders (rewards speculators who bought debt, ignores originators [war vets] who supported revolution; BUT establishes property rights precedent)&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Taxation by central government&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Central bank (Bank of US)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madison&#39;s Plan:&lt;br /&gt;
Moral victory; fair to citizens who gave the most during revolutionary war. BUT long-term implications for future investors if government can intervene in market.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Name Your Price: Compensation at Whole Health Management (MONV, Tuesday, Week 1)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/tuesday-week-1-2/"/>
		<updated>2012-01-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/tuesday-week-1-2/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Salary negotiation =&amp;gt; some considerations&lt;br /&gt;
-- What do I want besides money? (strong ties with mentor; communicate confidence in myself)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Comparables (justification; reference point)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Long-term considerations (anchor value for the future)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One perspective:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/comp-graph.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/comp-graph-300x247.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;comp graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales jobs =&amp;gt; commission structure usually more of the norm (low-high; &amp;quot;trusting hero&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common mistake: salary negotiation can be a test; might be smart to leave a little bit on the table&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big three job search mistakes:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Not relying on your full interest set&lt;br /&gt;
-- Bias towards measurement ($)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Bias on the short-term (first-year compensation)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Lack of introspection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Ignoring recruiter&#39;s interests&lt;br /&gt;
-- As a recruiter (HR in big company)&lt;br /&gt;
-- As a boss/partner&lt;br /&gt;
-- As a manager (offer letters set a precedent for compensation within company)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Transactional vs. repeated game&lt;br /&gt;
-- If you take the job, you have to work at the company. NOT a one-off negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/aardvark-ltv-wednesday-week-1/"/>
		<updated>2012-01-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/aardvark-ltv-wednesday-week-1/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Was Aardvark a &amp;quot;lean startup?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes: hypothesis-driven, frequent smoke tests, high frequency of release, lots of prototyping (Mechanical Turk)&lt;br /&gt;
No: prioritized user acquisition, NOT hypothesis-driven (vision/persistence vs. arrogance/refusal to take feedback?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Aardvark really viral? NO!&lt;br /&gt;
-- Not a game.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Not clear social value for users to share (no ego gain, like Quora or Klout)&lt;br /&gt;
-- No inherent incentives to share.&lt;br /&gt;
-- No social extensions/integration with social platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perennial lean startup challenge:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Founders pick a business model they like.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Hypothesis testing: Hard to differentiate between legitimate affirmation and false positives.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Hard to keep testing core &amp;quot;big assumptions&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Talent hits a target no one else can hit; genius hits a target no one else can see.&amp;quot; -- Schopenhauer (via Jeff Bussgang)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Chim on Aardvark:&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Startups live hand to mouth.&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; Can&#39;t possibly test everything; stage investment accordingly&lt;br /&gt;
-- Aardvark spent 30-40% of engineering effort on enabling A/B testing and metric collection =&amp;gt; You need to design everything around making tests possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Testing: &amp;quot;We would get four users every week off the street (via Craigslist post). We had users before we knew what we were even testing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Hired engineers who didn&#39;t know how to code. =&amp;gt; It causes trouble when you look at a problem and start thinking, &amp;quot;I know how to solve this...&amp;quot; and then immediately start building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- It&#39;s hard to separate timing/implementation from the idea in hypothesis-testing. Especially in network-effects businesses...&lt;br /&gt;
Did your test fail because the idea was bad, or because you didn&#39;t market well enough/have enough users for the product to be valuable when you ran the test?&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/dropbox-ltv-monday-week-1/"/>

		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/dropbox-ltv-monday-week-1/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Concerns about Dropbox:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Is this a feature or a product? Steve Jobs is dismissive...&lt;br /&gt;
-- Not the first movers, and seems like switching costs will be high.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Profit formula = questionable.&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Feature complication&amp;quot; --- How do you evolve a product whose chief virtue is simplicity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVP: Sync that just works (mindlessly) =&amp;gt; share + backup + sync&lt;br /&gt;
Only 2-3% paid users =&amp;gt; 39 free users per paid user.&lt;br /&gt;
Annual storage costs (AMZN S3): $0.11 per free user, $3.18 per paid user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit formula: LTV (Lifetime value of an acquired customer) vs. CAC (Cost of an acquired customer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LTV:&lt;br /&gt;
Paying users = $120/year.&lt;br /&gt;
Variable cost = ($3.18 x 12 mo) = $38.16&lt;br /&gt;
So, annual gross margin for a single paying customer = $81.84&lt;br /&gt;
We don&#39;t know attrition rate; let&#39;s assume 1 year (worst case).&lt;br /&gt;
So, LTV = $81.84&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAC:&lt;br /&gt;
Free users are Dropbox&#39;s marketing cost.&lt;br /&gt;
So, CAC = ($0.11 x 12 mo x 39) = $54.48&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LTV &amp;gt; CAC, but how much greater?&lt;br /&gt;
Skok says ratio should be 3:1 for SaaS businesses. But (1) we don&#39;t know actual churn and (2) storage costs will continue to fall, so margin will increase and CAC will decrease in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other interesting element: Dropbox established customer demand for product before they launched/built.&lt;br /&gt;
Thousands of sign-ups based on an MVP video: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=7QmCUDHpNzE&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=7QmCUDHpNzE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Day 4, Silicon Valley IXP</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/day-four-silicon-valley-ixp/"/>
		<updated>2012-01-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/day-four-silicon-valley-ixp/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shopkick company visit (Doug Galen, Chief Revenue Officer)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/IMG_0549.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/IMG_0549-300x224.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;shopkicking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Each one of my jobs has been --- in my own definition --- a holy crusade.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; eBay = little guys vs. big guy in retail&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Shutterfly = photo storage for a new dad&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Shopkick = the retail experience is bad; technology can make it personal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On career moves:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Do informational interviews until the cows come home.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Think about your personal pitch: &amp;quot;I&#39;m the real estate guy who can make things happen on the Internet&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;I know a ton about commercial real estate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biz dev (or, how a dinky Silicon Valley startup does a deal with Citi)&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Use your network to get the right intros: board members, friends, colleagues. Cold-calls can work, but they have a low probability of success.&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Be relentless.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Have passion and conviction about your idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staging a launch: Shopkick needed to prove that people would use it. Testing validated their hypothesis, but also made them realize that people would try to game the system (vast majority of check-ins were fraudulent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shopkick&#39;s critical mix: sticky (personalized), rewarding (builds brand loyalty), fun.&lt;br /&gt;
Ruled out any features/decisions that did not obviously benefit consumers. Users don&#39;t like being exploited. And why are you in business anyway? Probably not to take advantage of your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing a product that fits into existing behavior: look at absolutely every asset/behavior =&amp;gt; the microphone on a smartphone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shopkick did not execute Lean. Problems with small-scale testing/limited commitment from customers:&lt;br /&gt;
-- It takes big companies forever to scale up investment&lt;br /&gt;
-- Without skin in the game, customers wouldn&#39;t put real muscle behind product roll-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shopkick retail partners: actual purchasing decision always ended up at CEO or CMO level. Great for getting buy-in, but makes the selling process a lot more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons from &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefunded.com/&quot;&gt;TheFunded.com&lt;/a&gt; (Adeo Ressi)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Your job is to kill bad ideas.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
(Also, &amp;quot;What was that nod you gave me?!?&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adeo&#39;s seven rules:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Simple ideas win. (Complex ideas die)&lt;br /&gt;
One company, one product, one revenue source&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- You have one revenue stream. (Or a bad business)&lt;br /&gt;
And the steps to revenue should be few (partner arrangements don&#39;t usually work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Name your ideal customer. (And befriend them)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Make something explainable. (In 10 words or less)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Small markets suck. (And you will die winning them. Because it&#39;s not energizing/fun.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Mix in some secret sauce. (To show that you&#39;re an expert)&lt;br /&gt;
Example: B2C secret sauce tends to be around user acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Be original. (By being new or better)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional takeaways:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Don&#39;t name your company something that you yourself cannot pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Don&#39;t name your company something that is difficult to spell.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Avoid buzzwords (or at least be able to pitch your idea without them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Management (Marty Cagan)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Our job is to invent on behalf of the user.&amp;quot; -- Jeff Bezos&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Obsess over your customers. Become the undisputed expert on them. If you&#39;re not meeting with three of them per week, you&#39;re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No facts exist inside the building; only opinions.&amp;quot; -- Steve Blank&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Distinguish vision from illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you continue to improve a product enough, you&#39;ll eventually ruin it.&amp;quot; -- David Pogue&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Define success. Know what you are trying to accomplish; have a scorecard for your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Embrace user experience. Design is how it all works, not just how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&#39;t fall in love.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Get customer feedback every two weeks at least; avoid getting attached to ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) Fail fast. Make product discovery the core competency of your product function.&lt;br /&gt;
Do A/B testing to prove/disprove that something works. Do customer observation to figure out why something works (or doesn&#39;t work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6) Ensure true collaboration (between product manager, designer, and developer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing is what happens when too many people have to agree.&amp;quot; -- Seth Godin&lt;br /&gt;
(7) Improve fast. Products should be viable, usable, and feasible (compare to Ideo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(8) Be agile. Build and deploy incrementally, but have a compelling overall vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(9) Demand excellence. Worry about every pixel.&lt;br /&gt;
Someone&#39;s first experience meeting Jeff Bezos: Bezos on top of a desk in his office yelling, &amp;quot;Someone get me a gun so I can shoot myself so that I don&#39;t have to face our customers after we expose them to this product.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Any company that has something called an Innovation Lab --- there&#39;s probably a problem.&amp;quot; -- Cagan (ouch)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers and Founders event (Tom Eisenmann and Ben Horowitz [Netscape, LoudCloud, Andreessen Horowitz])&lt;br /&gt;
Classic MBA problems:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Delusional sense of competence&lt;br /&gt;
-- Sense of entitlement&lt;br /&gt;
-- Wrong kind of ambition (hungry for yourself, not hungry for the company)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Lean Startup: Part of finding your product market is figuring out how to sell the product.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It turns out, selling things is hard.&amp;quot; -- Ben Horowitz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People think that the best technology always wins. Actually, the best technology doesn&#39;t always win (example: Oracle). But the winning product becomes the best technology, because they make all the money and hire the best engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life in a startup:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I find you only experience two emotions --- terror and euphoria --- and the lack of sleep enhances them both.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On companies with long-term vision:&lt;br /&gt;
Think about the 20th employee. Because he or she is not getting any equity, but you need to be able to emotionally move people enough to attract someone good.&lt;br /&gt;
This resonated with me a lot (example: athenahealth).&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/day-five-silicon-valley-ixp/"/>
		<updated>2012-01-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/day-five-silicon-valley-ixp/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Facebook company visit (Sheryl Sandberg [COO], Lori Goler [VP of People and Recruiting])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/IMG_0553.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/IMG_0553-224x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;facebooking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sheryl Sandberg:&lt;br /&gt;
Many things are better with social. Why do people play Zynga instead of sophisticated games? It&#39;s not because of &amp;quot;features&amp;quot; or realism or graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career advice:\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get your hands dirty. Get a sales or marketing or operations job. And do real work.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I still do sales calls.&amp;quot; -- Sheryl Sandberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for growing companies. Growth is more important than titles/&amp;quot;level&amp;quot; at every stage of your career.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Get on a rocket ship, and good things will happen.&amp;quot; -- Eric Schmidt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On finding mentors:&lt;br /&gt;
Relationships are based on &amp;quot;real stuff.&amp;quot; Be the best, and you will develop mentors. Don&#39;t e-mail them and ask if they will sponsor you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait, what&#39;s Big Data?&amp;quot; -- Sheryl Sandberg&lt;br /&gt;
Data alone is useless. Similar reaction to &#39;credentialing.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lori Goler:&lt;br /&gt;
The answer to basically every case at HBS is &amp;quot;get the right people.&amp;quot; So probably you should think about how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Came to Facebook because of Zuck&#39;s vision: connecting people to the people and things that are important to them.&lt;br /&gt;
Strong institutional focus on impact. (Reflection: Is this really a value? I&#39;m not sure; I wanted to push back but ran out of time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On her initial hesitancy to become HR lead at Facebook:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No man would ever turn down more responsibility!&amp;quot; -- Sheryl Sandberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflections on an Entrepreneurial Career in SV (Randy Komisar)&lt;br /&gt;
Consumer web is a small part of the world, even the venture world. And TechCrunch has become the People Magazine of the IT business.&lt;br /&gt;
Why is it hyped? Low barriers to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequence: consumer web is more like the media business than the innovation business.&lt;br /&gt;
There were 12 Instagrams when Instagram started; now there&#39;s only one. And the critical factor was probably not technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theses for the future: Internet of Things (Nest, other devices that work so well that people bring them into their lives). Big Data and how we use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why big-name venture still chases trends: because their business works best when I read about KPCB in TechCrunch every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall personal take-away:&lt;br /&gt;
Build stuff you care about; don&#39;t chase fads and gold rushes. Life is too short.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mentor meeting (Scott Hartsmann [Trion Worlds] and Fred Wang [Trinity Ventures])&lt;br /&gt;
How to use lean customer development in a MMO startup (time to market: five years)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Expose the storyline to customers early&lt;br /&gt;
-- Expose PMs and developers to customers via Twitter, Facebook, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not that hard to get a non-technical job at some Silicon Valley startup. People are reluctant to move to San Francisco, hat in hand, and try to get a job. But actually being there &amp;quot;focuses the mind.&amp;quot; Maybe not the best idea right away, but easier than you&#39;d imagine (ex ante).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t ever burn bridges/scorch earth leaving an employer. The world is too small, especially given how easy it is to do background checks via LinkedIn (find indirect links to prospective employees; perform informal due diligence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch at Kleiner Perkins (Aileen Lee)&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#39;t talk about the exit in a pitch. Your (prospective) investors can figure it out, and they will if they&#39;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easiest way to raise money: have a working prototype and some customers/prospective customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indirect observation/trend: Ask how people use a product/service, not what they think about it.&lt;br /&gt;
Basically all of the smart people I encountered so far ask &amp;quot;Do you use Pinterest? How do you use it?&amp;quot; and not &amp;quot;Do you like Pinterest?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Heidi Roizen exists. She is very nice and incredibly savvy. Also, I would never want to be an HBS case protagonist (aka MBA celebrity) --- it&#39;s a little weird to have 950 people judge you based on a 10-page excerpt of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enduring relationships are based on &#39;real things&#39; and being useful to others, not glad-handing at parties.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Day 2, Silicon Valley IXP</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/day-2-silicon-valley-ixp/"/>
		<updated>2012-01-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/day-2-silicon-valley-ixp/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;James Slavet/Adam Nash (Greylock), &amp;quot;State of the Space&amp;quot; on Consumer Internet&lt;br /&gt;
What&#39;s an Entrepreneur-in-Residence?\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone working on their &#39;next big thing&#39; at a VC firm. Uses VC office space, gets exposure to VC dealflow.&lt;br /&gt;
Usually no formal expectation that the VC firm will invest.&lt;br /&gt;
Usually unpaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s an Executive-in-Residence?\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone looking for their next CEO role; usually takes 6-10 months to find.&lt;br /&gt;
Gets exposure to VC dealflow.&lt;br /&gt;
Usually is paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greylock only invests in software; segments investments into consumer and enterprise.&lt;br /&gt;
Basic investment theses: social graph, mobile, Big Data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The iPhone broke open enterprise IT departments.&amp;quot; -- Adam Nash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three basic models to monetize consumer:&lt;br /&gt;
Advertising &amp;gt; Out of vogue; need either 100M users or 30M users who are super-desirable or somehow specialized in their needs.&lt;br /&gt;
Subscription &amp;gt; Lends itself to analytics; usually very high-margin.&lt;br /&gt;
Transactions/commerce &amp;gt; Traditionally hard, but wave of interesting new startups. Key changes: more like subscription in terms of customer stickiness; maybe not holding inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depressing math about outcomes:&lt;br /&gt;
-- There are two new companies a year worth &amp;gt; $1B&lt;br /&gt;
-- There are 15-20 new companies a year worth &amp;gt; $100-200M&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, most big VCs invest to make a $50M cash return. Think about financing through that lens, because it&#39;s how VC investors are thinking about it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PunchTab Case&lt;br /&gt;
Major, enduring takeaway: Silicon Valley thrives on reputation, track record, and signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Sturiale: don&#39;t bootstrap; liquidity takes forever (8-10 years for a successful exit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed-round term sheets are always negotiable. You&#39;ll need an A Round from somewhere...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned from Mike Cassidy&lt;br /&gt;
Speed wins. Fast product rollouts make it hard for competitors to keep up, build morale, and give you good PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On biz dev: Deals close fast or not at all. &amp;quot;The probability of a deal closing declines by 10% each day that the deal doesn&#39;t close.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral coefficient = X x Y x Z&lt;br /&gt;
where X = % of users exposed to trial&lt;br /&gt;
Y = % of users who invite friends&lt;br /&gt;
Z = Average # of friends invited&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If viral coefficient &amp;gt; 1, you can do short-hand math to see that user acquisition happens incredibly fast.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: 1.02 =&amp;gt; rule of 72 implies that number of users doubles every 36 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On pitching a product without actually having a product:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Get &amp;quot;If...than&amp;quot; commitments from customers (If you built this product, I would buy X units).&lt;br /&gt;
-- Figure out how you&#39;d build it (team, Gantt chart for development timeline, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge takeaway: there are some people (Mike Cassidy) who think about the world in a very different way from me. And sometimes they build $500M companies in under 500 days. And I am impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter company visit (Satya Patel, VP of Product)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/IMG_0524.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/IMG_0524-300x224.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0524&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Twitter&#39;s competition (broadly): anyone consuming users&#39; time&lt;br /&gt;
Twitter is a &amp;quot;many-to-many&amp;quot; medium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truths:&lt;br /&gt;
-- It is very hard to change consumer behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Successful Internet businesses address one single use case very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model for thinking about Twitter users:&lt;br /&gt;
Activation =&amp;gt; Consumption =&amp;gt; Engagement =&amp;gt; Creation&lt;br /&gt;
(I have previously heard this as segmenting user base into consumers, curators, and creators)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter has seven core values (didn&#39;t actually go through all of them):&lt;br /&gt;
-- Ship it.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Simplify.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Passion and personality matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the PM role: product management is an editorial function. PMs are primarily curators.&lt;br /&gt;
Engineering lead on a Twitter team runs daily scrums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare company visit (Michelle Zatlyn, Matthew Prince)&lt;br /&gt;
Think about building awareness when you announce new products. Cloudflare launched at TechCrunch disrupt; benefitted from winning HBS business plan competition.&lt;br /&gt;
Announcing a financing round is free publicity. You should do it when you need publicity, NOT as soon as you close the round. Inevitable TechCrunch write-up helps hiring, don&#39;t announce financing just to stoke your egos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To think about: in an early-stage venture, what you are worth is in part a function of how much money you raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how your financers view the world: Monday morning VC partners meeting; weekly &amp;quot;news cycle&amp;quot; within venture firms, outside investors need to justify everything to their partners/colleagues. Make their lives easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A macro thesis about the world: Internet publishers still cannot monetize their content effectively. This must change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thredUP company visit (James Reinhart, Chris Homer)&lt;br /&gt;
Started as &amp;quot;Netflix for shirts!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One basic demo tool: print out wireframes, sit down with a user and let them &amp;quot;click through.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools for customer feedback:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Moms on staff!&lt;br /&gt;
-- Vibrant Facebook community =&amp;gt; Easy to ask questions about product decisions. But are the answers always right? Users don&#39;t like change...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good products don&#39;t distribute themselves.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Secular tendency for startups to ignore the importance of go-to-market and focus exclusively on how to build the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; product.&lt;br /&gt;
Some business models require a lot of press to acquire customers, and it&#39;s hard to get good customer observation without enough early adopters. Chase reporters if necessary; get familiar with bloggers and news sources that your customers use.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Day 1, Silicon Valley IXP</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/day-1-silicon-valley-ixp/"/>
		<updated>2012-01-14T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sierra Ventures &amp;quot;State of the Space&amp;quot; on Venture Investment&lt;br /&gt;
VC is an industry of collusion as much as cooperation (why vast majority of reputable firms are on Sand Hill Road)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting concept: Sierra&#39;s &amp;quot;CIO Advisory Group&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; informal relationship with CIOs of 75 large tech firms&lt;br /&gt;
-- Makes it easy for portfolio companies to get feedback from potential enterprise customers&lt;br /&gt;
-- Enables Sierra to get information on market dynamics to drive investment decisions (Will big IT departments buy the latest, greatest SaaS CRM app?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow of LP money into VC has tailed off in the last 24 months. Not all is well.&lt;br /&gt;
Why? Frothy environment? Mediocre returns across VC asset class as a whole? Low barriers to entry for software startups driving VC disintermediation (angels and growth equity are still huge)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Ries on the Lean Startup&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&#39;m a big failure. If you follow me, you too can be a big failure.&amp;quot; -- E.R.&lt;br /&gt;
(Caveat: clearly I am a fairly serious believer in the value of hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship, or I wouldn&#39;t have pre-ordered/read the book and most of Ries&#39; blog posts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lack of customer development:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Most entrepreneurs are waiting for Zool.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_w0mEfOJ78lo/TS5paabd8fI/AAAAAAAAAHU/7KhX-eg5VRs/s1600/zool.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic premise is that development of IT has changed the nature of tech entrepreneurship. Almost everything can be built. You CAN build a social network for dogs. Our problems have shifted from:&lt;br /&gt;
We don&#39;t have enough stuff (productive capacity).&lt;br /&gt;
TO&lt;br /&gt;
How do we make the right stuff (allocation)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ries on all successful companies:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Founders look like idiots at the beginning.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Publicists and ghostwriters and marketing departments for successful companies make it seem like the founders were visionary at the beginning. Usually not true.&lt;br /&gt;
Examples:&lt;br /&gt;
Digital cash for PDAs =&amp;gt; Online payments for eBay (PayPal)&lt;br /&gt;
A better BASIC interpreter =&amp;gt; the most enduring operating system monopoly on the planet (Microsoft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whatever you think [about your new venture], you&#39;re probably wrong.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDEO group activities/tour&lt;br /&gt;
Critical factors: (1) empathy for your users and (2) humility to learn from your users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to learn from your users: Listen to specific stories; don&#39;t ask general questions.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: &amp;quot;How did you get home for Christmas last month?&amp;quot; NOT &amp;quot;How do you usually get home for the holidays?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good products are: Feasible (technology), Viable (business), Desirable (human factors/design)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Dearing, Harrison Metal (incubator)&lt;br /&gt;
Incubators = between retail-level angel investors and traditional VC funds. Sweet spot is the time between technical insight and actual paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic investment model: $500K-$1M investment, exit in 5-10 years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriesseed.com/&quot;&gt;Series Seed Equity Documents&lt;/a&gt; =&amp;gt; easy template for early-stage equity financing&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/thursday-week-13-2/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I believe that, like, Gilt has turned me into an even better multi-tasker than I was before!&amp;quot; -- thrilled Gilt customer&lt;br /&gt;
Gilt has 4M members. Holy moly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Michael Bryzek, our CTO and co-founder, was in the warehouse packing boxes for the first few months.&amp;quot; -- Alexis Maybank&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really complex business model.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;72% of our revenues are earned in 90 minutes every day ... All of our customer support calls happen in 90 minutes every day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of time pressure, fast throughput, business model could not really exist offline.&lt;br /&gt;
Need a ton of Kiva robots, tons of data to create &amp;quot;curated&amp;quot; collection specific to the customer, and high enough volume to get decent pricing.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You can&#39;t really serve 4M people with leftovers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Gilt take off?&lt;br /&gt;
Buy from your suppliers 30 days net; collect from your customers in a little over two weeks. Negative NWC from very early on...&lt;br /&gt;
Early conversations about Rich vs. King; not framed in exactly that way. But founders quickly hired a CEO and COO to run Gilt when it started blowing up.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>What Makes an Outstanding [Investor] Presentation (15.390, Monday, Week 14)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/monday-week-14/"/>
		<updated>2011-12-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/monday-week-14/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Consider the audience.&lt;br /&gt;
Customers? Potential employees or partners? Investors? Influencers (press, analysts, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell a story with real people. Make it graphic. Base it on your customer persona.&lt;br /&gt;
If possible, use props. (Multimodal sensory integration, Heath&#39;s &amp;quot;Made to Stick&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every investor presentation has three points.&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Huge market opportunity&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Proprietary, patented solution AND great team&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Just need $500K&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with the story, not with the team.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know your mother told you to always introduce yourself, but I&#39;m going to tell you something different.&amp;quot; -- Bill Aulet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hide most details away in the appendix. Anticipate questions; have a backup slide for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do in a presentation is stand out.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Knock people out of homeostasis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Own a buzzword.&lt;br /&gt;
Examples: &amp;quot;inbound marketing&amp;quot; (Hubspot) or &amp;quot;social commerce&amp;quot; (Curisma)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold:&lt;br /&gt;
Actual evidence, real results, signed contracts, &amp;quot;Public beta: 8K users,&amp;quot; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Optional Firing Workshop (FD, Monday, Week 14)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/monday-week-14-2/"/>
		<updated>2011-12-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/monday-week-14-2/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;-- Context for early-stage companies is different&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Typically not the same &amp;quot;runway&amp;quot; for employees to improve as large firms&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Typically a lot more firings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Two types of firing: performance-related vs. direction/fit-related&lt;br /&gt;
-- Neither should come as a surprise. Do quarterly reviews, other good management practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIRING SOMEONE&lt;br /&gt;
Where: Conference room, no interior windows&lt;br /&gt;
When: Early in the week, late in the day&lt;br /&gt;
Who: Manager plus one other &amp;quot;company voice&amp;quot; (HR, COO, CFO, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
What: All paperwork ready in advance; have answers to any conceivable question&lt;br /&gt;
How: Get straight to the point.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Don&#39;t get involved in deep conversation or debate.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Stick to observables, not impressions.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Do make confirming remarks about former employee&#39;s character if relevant (&amp;quot;appreciate your hard work,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;value your dedication,&amp;quot; etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Emphasize finality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Threat of termination is a slippery slope.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Don&#39;t drag it out.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Think about what you want out of the former employee, post-departure. It&#39;s probably not &amp;quot;nothing.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-- Don&#39;t tell other employees that someone their co-worker was fired; tell them his/her last day was XXX (maybe exceptions for felony). &amp;quot;Circumstances surrounding his/her departure were personal and confidential&amp;quot; or something.&lt;br /&gt;
Would you want other people to know that you were fired, or what you were fired for? No.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Accretive Health (EF, Wednesday, Week 13)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/wednesday-week-13/"/>
		<updated>2011-12-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/wednesday-week-13/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s wrong with healthcare?&lt;br /&gt;
Herzlinger: Consumers don&#39;t have information or incentives to make sensible choices.&lt;br /&gt;
Porter: Ineffective competition in healthcare does not produce greater consumer surplus.&lt;br /&gt;
Christensen: Muted incentives and artificial barriers to entry prevent disruptive entrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accretive =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;plump&amp;quot; startup &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Initially, small team of senior execs. Sell Clearview on taking over their revenue cycle; instantly have $100M in revenue.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&#39;t spend the money to build capabilities; sign the client first. It worked at Accenture. We (Accretive) started with eight people.&amp;quot; -- Etienne Deffarges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other nice things: high touch, no upfront cost to hospitals, hospitals pre-pay = negative OWC. Dual focus on (1) reducing revenue leakage and (2) cutting cost of collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etienne Deffarges:&lt;br /&gt;
The revenue cycle model is basically a zero-sum game (gains to hospital come at the expense of payors). Not too much opportunity to take cost out of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic model for QTCC (building an ACO):&lt;br /&gt;
Go to the payors, get them to agree to reimburse at 98% of last year&#39;s rates. Then, cut cost by 20%. Split the savings between providers, hospital, and Accretive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More sophisticated model for QTCC:&lt;br /&gt;
Large incentive payments to PCPs to alter care allocation. Then, hospitals increase number of PCPs (more PCPs per specialist/ER doc.).&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Instead of PCPs spending 15 minutes on every patient, pay more attention to high-risk patients and follow up. Use metrics like hospital readmission.&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Five percent of patients = 50% of healthcare cost. Ten percent of patients = 67% of healthcare cost.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Trouble Ahead... (15.390, Wednesday, Week 13)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/wednesday-week-13-2/"/>
		<updated>2011-12-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/wednesday-week-13-2/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When things go wrong...&lt;br /&gt;
Product problems lead to PR/Marketing problems lead to Sales problems lead to Cashflow problems lead to HR problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim to catch problems early and get out of them. But how??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem #1: Missed sales targets&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; No one hits sales targets. 75% of VC-backed firms miss their initial sales targets in dramatic ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need three sales plans:&lt;br /&gt;
Official plan --- 100%&lt;br /&gt;
Sales budget --- 115%&lt;br /&gt;
Operating plan --- 80-85%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; Decision: Is this a permanent problem OR a temporary problem?&lt;br /&gt;
And so, do we: Change the plan OR keep on pushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&#39;s permanent, get to break-even. Cut expenses, cut salaries, cut people, reduce need for capital, steady the ship and then reassess. No one will ever tell you to do this. Angels won&#39;t tell you to fire people (too nice); VCs won&#39;t really tell you to fire people. You won&#39;t be popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Duffield (PeopleSoft founder) gave $200M to dog and cat shelters after his first liquidity event. He said that when he came home, his dog was always happy to see him. Nobody else was happy to see him, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem #2: Product doesn&#39;t work, or it&#39;s late, or it&#39;s wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Most products are late, and there is always pressure to ship buggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; Decision: Is this the right product or the wrong one?&lt;br /&gt;
The real danger = &amp;quot;I&#39;m making the wrong product, but I&#39;m making it really well.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Rarely obvious; usually begins as a suspicion.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: IBM spent billions building awesome automated factories to build dot-matrix printers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&#39;s the right product, take steps to avoid shipping something buggy. Appoint a quality czar who won&#39;t be bullied. If pressed, cut features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The engineers will bitch, because features have replaced sex and fast driving in their lives.&amp;quot; -- Howard Anderson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you manage the pressure of a late product?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Drinking. I always find that drinking works.&amp;quot; -- Howard Anderson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem #3: Key employee leaves&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Damage control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to say:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Promise me that if this job doesn&#39;t work out, I&#39;ll be the first call you make.&lt;br /&gt;
[I might not hire you back, but...]&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Promise me that you&#39;ll give me a call if you need a recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;
[I might not give you one]&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Promise me that you won&#39;t poach the rest of my team, because I really need them.&lt;br /&gt;
Get an immediate commitment on the last one.&lt;br /&gt;
Send a follow-up with a letter (it can be nice and warm and fuzzy) confirming that the former employee won&#39;t poach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem #4: Running out of cash&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; Obviously, get to break-even (see above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Cut burn rate. If you&#39;re not shipping yet, cut sales guys. Cut sales before engineering and production, cut staff before line.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Raise money. Never stop raising money.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Tell your board early.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Meet with employees regularly.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Stretch payables, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big one: Tell your lead investor 90 days before you will run out of money. They will not take it nearly as badly as you are taking it.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Remember: if you&#39;re a VC, five out of six of your companies are almost out of money. It&#39;s like running a cancer ward! Every once in a while someone climbs out of bed and runs the Boston Marathon, but...&amp;quot; -- Howard Anderson&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Dr. John&#39;s Products (EF, Thursday, Week 13)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/thursday-week-13/"/>
		<updated>2011-12-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/thursday-week-13/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I build two things: I build a product and I build a company-as-a-product.&amp;quot; -- John Osher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opportunity:&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone needs toothbrushes, and big players (P&amp;amp;G, Braun) have been unable to build brand loyalty. Loyalty in toothpaste, loyalty in razors, no loyalty in toothbrushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge advantage:&lt;br /&gt;
John Osher had Chinese factories making 200M Spin Pops per year. Easy to build on that to make a small number of Spin Brushes; factory set-up looks similar (need sanitary manufacturing facilities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially disruptive technology, reframed so that it could be easily added to a big company as a sustaining innovation:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Our competitors considered us a gimmick.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
All competitors besides P&amp;amp;G had major plays in electric toothbrushes, which made it hard for them to sell a dirt-cheap semi-electric toothbrush. Concerns about cannibalization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company started with an exit strategy: Sale to P&amp;amp;G&lt;br /&gt;
-- Knew earnings mattered, so focused on profit early&lt;br /&gt;
-- Build company so that it would be accretive to earnings for P&amp;amp;G&lt;br /&gt;
-- No brand loyalty = easy to sell to a strategic buyer&lt;br /&gt;
-- Factories contracted so that they would pass P&amp;amp;G standards&lt;br /&gt;
-- Didn&#39;t license internationally so that sale would be simpler&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; $480M exit in about 3 years. Highest volume toothbrush in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling retail products can be done without much sales overhead; Dr John&#39;s had only 10 accounts with meaningful volume (Wal-Mart, Target, Walgreens, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Osher on retirement:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;First of all, I got burnt on the beach and I&#39;m bad on the golf course.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Daniel Kahneman on how you experience life vs. how you remember life:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Duration doesn&#39;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: 30-year marriage where the first 27 years were great and then you had 3 years of fights and a messy divorce. You don&#39;t actually think about the fact that the good years far outstripped the bad...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) It&#39;s all about the peaks and the end.&lt;br /&gt;
You don&#39;t really remember the troughs (tough moments) in hindsight, as long as the highs were high and things ended well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collected learnings from the semester (from the class as a whole)&lt;br /&gt;
-- See people as they want to be, not just as they are.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Find/create LDG-like settings where you can think intentionally about your life. Because you won&#39;t get the best insight from your spouse, your parents, your close friends, your co-workers, or your boss.&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;It&#39;s okay to have high-class problems; it&#39;s not okay to think they&#39;re real problems.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-- Everyone is uncomfortable about something.&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Ask for help when you need it.&amp;quot; Also, in hindsight, ask for help when you don&#39;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;

		<title>Role of the CEO/OnStar (BSSE, Tuesday, Week 13)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/tuesday-week-13/"/>
		<updated>2011-11-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/tuesday-week-13/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;GM and OnStar =&amp;gt; value propositions, resources, processes, and profit models are almost entirely orthogonal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is OnStar a good idea?&lt;br /&gt;
There is a big job out there waiting to be done (safety and security). AAA, cell phones, and 911 dramatically under-serve the customer base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of possible theories. Most interesting takeaway:&lt;br /&gt;
OnStar&#39;s success (like most disruptive business models) came from integrating around a different job-to-be-done/establishing a simplified product through interdependence.&lt;br /&gt;
But they started out modular --- they outsourced almost everything. Is this a mistake?&lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; NO. Emergent strategy means you need tons of flexibility in your business --- so you start modular. When you don&#39;t know exactly what the job to be done is, you shouldn&#39;t invest in a robust set of interdependent capabilities. You&#39;ll probably get it wrong!&lt;br /&gt;
OnStar initially thought their opportunity was mobile concierge services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you have a chance to shape an idea disruptively, you should do it. But what does that even mean??&amp;quot; -- Chet Huber&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was a locomotive salesman, so you could convince me of anything...Our job started off as &#39;anything technology can do.&#39; It was terrible. We had advisors singing showtunes to people in their cars.&amp;quot; -- Chet Huber&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You get to call it an &#39;emergent strategy&#39; later. At the time, it&#39;s like, &#39;Holy cow, it blew up again.&#39;&amp;quot; -- Chet Huber&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>FD Optional Panel on Pitching (FD, Tuesday, Week 13 (Part 2))</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/tuesday-week-13-part-2/"/>
		<updated>2011-11-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/tuesday-week-13-part-2/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;with &lt;em&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Herjavec&quot;&gt;Robert Herjavec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daymond_John&quot;&gt;Daymond John&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban&quot;&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched excerpts from &lt;em&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt; and discussed/critiqued them. Noam and Deepak Malhotra led the class session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Herjavec, on being a panelist:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;First of all, this is the longest I&#39;ve ever sat in one place without saying something.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the introduction:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Capture the imagination of your audience immediately. (Rob)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Don&#39;t give out data at the very start --- peoples&#39; eyes glaze over&lt;br /&gt;
BUT if you can&#39;t touch/see the product, you need data early. (Daymond)&lt;br /&gt;
-- If you have a less tangible or B2B venture, you need a more eloquent/emotional pitch. (Rob)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Captivate, but don&#39;t stretch the limits of credibility. It took MSFT 10 years to get to $50M in sales. (Rob)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Are you pitching a company or a product? Probably you want to start a company. (Noam)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On confidence and lack thereof:&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;If you bring up bad news upfront, it&#39;s not bad news. It&#39;s just a data point.&amp;quot; (Rob)&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Venrock has a set of 25 evaluation criteria for pitches --- 12 of the 25 data points are decided on between when you walk in the front door and when you say the first word.&amp;quot; (Rob)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Mark Cuban&#39;s impromptu 24-second shot clock in the Origaudio episode:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Shockingly similar to traditional VC term sheets --- no-shop clause, exploding offer. (Noam)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Cuban tries to turn an auction into a negotiation. Terrible for the entrepreneurs. Best response: find a way to keep Cuban in the auction. &amp;quot;Mark, I am flattered by your offer etc. but I think you wouldn&#39;t actually want me to take a deal like this if I was running a business with your money.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Daymond offer to buy entrepreneurs out for $300K:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Thought they&#39;d be bad partners/managers.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Intended to take licenses and distribution agreement and run business himself...because he&#39;d probably end up doing that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;
Takeaway: Think about how some offers reveal the motivations of prospective investors. (Noam)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best entrepreneurs on &lt;em&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt;, according to Mark Cuban:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Know product, company, and industry cold.&lt;br /&gt;
-- The real test is Q&amp;amp;A, not the pitch. It reveals whether you were willing to do the prep work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best entrepreneurs on &lt;em&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt;, according to Daymond:&lt;br /&gt;
-- 100% commitment, long-term strategy, scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best entrepreneurs on &lt;em&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt;, according to Rob:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Captivate me (because I have a short attention span).&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Humble arrogance.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Know their numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, good presenters take control of questions. Polite; usually humorous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al (one of the entrepreneurs in the next season):&lt;br /&gt;
How did you prepare?&lt;br /&gt;
Five hours a day in the mirror (really?). But also, it&#39;s my life. Of course I can answer questions about it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/tuesday-week-13-2/"/>
		<updated>2011-11-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/tuesday-week-13-2/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do rich kings do it?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Industries/business models that are wide open (Apple)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Finding a &amp;quot;third path&amp;quot; (effective balance between creating value and keeping control)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Started early&lt;br /&gt;
-- Geography arbitrage? Take a proven business model and apply it somewhere else (&lt;a href=&quot;http://babies.com/&quot;&gt;Babies.com&lt;/a&gt; in Brazil)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovering from mistakes:&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Inertia&amp;quot; approach =&amp;gt; persistence; just keep on keeping on (Savage Beast/Pandora)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Reactive approach =&amp;gt; hit the &#39;undo&#39; key (Brian Scudamore at Rubbish Boys)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Proactive approach =&amp;gt; build firewalls, craft dynamic agreements (Genevieve Theirs at Sittercity)&lt;br /&gt;
Some class discussion around the superiority of the proactive approach. I am not entirely convinced; I think it&#39;s way harder to be &amp;quot;proactive&amp;quot; than people think and then we are unwilling to make hard decisions/hit &#39;undo&#39;/admit error in embarrassing ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noam&#39;s Life Lessons:&lt;br /&gt;
-- The ladder of success is actually a roller-coaster, not a ladder.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Pick a career that makes you excited to get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t postpone doing good until after you &amp;quot;make it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

		<title>Scaling the Business/Pitching (15.390, Monday, Week 13)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/monday-week-13/"/>
		<updated>2011-11-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/monday-week-13/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What makes entrepreneurial ventures successful and fun?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Alignment =&amp;gt; good new ventures usually have strong alignment between customers, employees, managers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
Why? Because if they don&#39;t have strong alignment, they don&#39;t make payroll.&lt;br /&gt;
Life is fun when everyone is on the same page.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Passion =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;because it&#39;s your thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenge: growth makes alignment more complicated. Is the customer buying from a company or from a person? Early on, it doesn&#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have a strategic plan around here: we do sh*t.&amp;quot; -- Old 15.390 TA&lt;br /&gt;
This is exactly right for new ventures. It gets less right as ventures start to scale up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On hiring friends:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If you have too many friends and you want to get rid of some of them, hiring them is a good way. Because the odds that your best friend should be your #2 are about 300-million-to-1.&amp;quot; -- Howard Anderson&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;All those people who were sitting around with you at The Muddy Charles saying &#39;I&#39;m in, I&#39;m in?&#39; They meant &#39;part-time in.&#39;&amp;quot; -- Bill Aulet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re giving away titles to early employees, the best titles are &#39;founder&#39; and &#39;co-founder.&#39; They sounds great, and you won&#39;t regret it if you need to hire someone to be their boss when your venture grows.&lt;br /&gt;
Be very careful about hiring Chief XYZ Officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On pitching your venture:&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#39;t ever end a pitch with &amp;quot;Thank you for your time.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
There must be an ask, and it must be actionable. Money, advice, a spot on your Board of Advisors, a referral to someone else, a follow-up meeting...&lt;br /&gt;
This is not a graded academic exercise. You want something, and if you don&#39;t then you shouldn&#39;t be giving the pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Theory of the CEO (BSSE, Monday, Week 13)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/monday-week-13-2/"/>
		<updated>2011-11-29T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Interesting commentary on the capabilities and limitations of the class...&lt;br /&gt;
If you&#39;re trying to build an airplane, which is more important to understand: gravity or Bernoulli&#39;s Principle?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;BSSE is a course about gravity.&amp;quot; -- Clay Christensen&lt;br /&gt;
Our class section seemed to think gravity is more important, which makes no sense to me. I can design a (bad, probably doomed) plane with a decent understanding of Bernoulli&#39;s Principle and some intuitive knowledge about the world (don&#39;t make the plane too heavy). Gravity gives me almost no insight into how to make a plane fly; it only describes for me how poorly-made planes fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several theories what CEOs do:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) CEO is in a reacting role, driven by expectations of investors and analysts =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Forces act on me; what&#39;s important is that I stay in balance and do what the Street wants.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
(2) CEO puts together a cohort of players/a winning team; CEO as teacher =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Does everyone involved understand how we make money so they will all perform their roles? I want no surprises.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
(3) CEO is a communicator of his vision/balancer vis-a-vis shareholders =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Be trusted, so that my company can make good long-term decisions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am intuitively drawn to (2) and (3), mostly because I think leaders actually should have insight into the best strategic/tactical path for their firms.&lt;br /&gt;
The &amp;quot;leader as caretaker&amp;quot; in (1) seems implausible.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Intel NBI/Managing Innovation and Creating Growth (Pt 2) (BSSE, Tuesday, Week 12)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/tuesday-week-12/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Vital Amines (or, &amp;quot;what&#39;s still missing if we understand disruption&amp;quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Where is &amp;quot;the edge of the earth?&amp;quot; Probably there is some limit to the level of innovation a company should pursue. Where does it lie? What types of innovations will actually never work for me/my company?&lt;br /&gt;
Example: Should Intel NBI have created &lt;a href=&quot;http://salesforce.com/&quot;&gt;salesforce.com&lt;/a&gt; or NetFlix? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Why do some firms with &amp;quot;disruptive potential&amp;quot; beat out others?&lt;br /&gt;
Example: There were hundreds of Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers in the late 80s/early 90s. There are currently three with 90-something percent market share --- Asustek, Acer, and HTC. What did they do different?&lt;br /&gt;
One thought: &amp;quot;deep dives&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; CEOs and key managers spent 5% of time on existing businesses and 70% on new businesses. If you have good processes for sustaining core business, best people should not focus on the core business. You need them to develop new processes for new businesses...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- What the heck do you do if you&#39;re a smart low-level employee at a firm that is messing up?&lt;br /&gt;
I.e. You&#39;re a junior guy at Intel and you see ARM/mobile on the horizon. You know it&#39;s going to kill Intel in 10 years if you don&#39;t do anything. What can you really do?&lt;br /&gt;
My Answer: Leave Intel, start a business around ARM...&lt;br /&gt;
Ironic, because the class is called &amp;quot;Building and Sustaining Successful Enterprises.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Nantucket Nectars: the Exit (FD, Tuesday, Week 12)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/tuesday-week-12-2/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Best class guests/case protagonists ever...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaways from negotiation:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Open with &amp;quot;congratulations&amp;quot; (or something positive).&lt;br /&gt;
-- If you are an acquirer, don&#39;t ever be a bidder in an auction. Figure out creative/non-financial/hard to value terms, ideally ones that don&#39;t do crazy things to the other party&#39;s incentives. Do anything you can to make the conversation about something other than price.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Multiple bidders =&amp;gt; higher valuation (duh)&lt;br /&gt;
-- In M&amp;amp;A, there are some features of the buyer that will always shape the deal/it&#39;s not just about price.&lt;br /&gt;
Examples: Pepsi can&#39;t credibly claim that they won&#39;t change a company&#39;s &amp;quot;entrepreneurial culture&amp;quot; upon acquisition. Ocean Spray (a co-op) can&#39;t offer acquiree&#39;s founders a piece of the upside --- it&#39;s a coop; there&#39;s no publicly-traded equity. Triarc can&#39;t credibly claim that they&#39;ll tolerate gradual growth or unprofitability --- it&#39;s a PE shop; they want to exit with a double-digit IRR in 5-8 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aftermath:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Get a fabulous lawyer when you exit. Tom &amp;amp; Tom missed earnout milestones, regretted selling to Ocean Spray within six months of closing, and still got paid because they had good lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We were ready to take the next step (getting liquidity), but not ready to give up the company.&amp;quot; -- Tom First&lt;br /&gt;
Epilogue: Pepsi control sounded great after six months working for Ocean Spray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our abilities were a subset of our desires.&amp;quot; -- Tom Scott&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On entrepreneurs at big companies (Ocean Spray vs. Pepsi):&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If you can&#39;t get the things that you need as a human, just take the money.&amp;quot; -- Tom Scott&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We got a call from Triarc, from Nelson Peltz. And he said we could meet anywhere in the world as long as it was within five miles of a helipad...I just remember the whole thing feeling dirty.&amp;quot; -- Tom First, on the possibility of selling Nantucket Nectars to PE&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A way to think about modularity and interdependence in the value chain:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Modularity is conformable (like mortar or clay)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Interdependence is solid (like bricks)&lt;br /&gt;
Buildings (and value chains) are built with alternating layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus (for semiconductors):&lt;br /&gt;
Fab Equipment = Interdependent (ex. Teradyne)&lt;br /&gt;
Fabrication =&amp;gt; Modular (?)&lt;br /&gt;
Microprocessor design =&amp;gt; Interdependent (ex. Intel)&lt;br /&gt;
Laptops =&amp;gt; Modular (ex. Dell)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two interdependent companies don&#39;t usually work well together. Need a layer of modularity...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIG Idea Group =&amp;gt; Fabulous business model but awful for customers. Mattel, et al. is outsourcing their highest value-add activity --- commoditizing themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
Personal opinion: &amp;quot;core competency&amp;quot; counter-argument (Mattel&#39;s core competency is marketing!) is irrelevant and facile; the profits in the industry won&#39;t accrue to marketing given industry structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big company executive: &amp;quot;We&#39;re just not innovative enough!&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; Actually, all of your downstream activities shape/limit what comes out of the bottom of the funnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a big company, think carefully before you outsource the hard stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea: NetFlix needs the best suggestion engine in the world. They offer $1M reward to the best submission. Some random dude outside firm develops best engine; NetFlix suggestion engine is ridiculously good/shapes business model.&lt;br /&gt;
Obviously hard to do this for everything, but...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franchisors:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Leverage local knowledge of managers who are aligned with system and passionate/motivated&lt;br /&gt;
-- Maintain control (or keep a lot of equity, at least)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franchisees:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Tradeoff between getting great terms and getting a great, proven system&lt;br /&gt;
-- Paul Guy ended up with a 1-800-GOT-TRASH franchise for the entire city of Toronto (biggest city in Canada) --- either impossible or insanely costly if he hadn&#39;t been the first franchisee...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When to incorporate? Right now. Form a Delaware C Corp; issue stock before you have a pre-money valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Forces conversations about equity.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Lets you issue stock.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Establishes a vehicle for your IP (the company), allows NDAs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-competes typically last a year in Massachusetts. They are enforceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resource (that real lawyers don&#39;t like): LegalZoom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your secrets to yourself/NDAs are overrated: If you&#39;re a startup and someone walks off with IP, are you really going to sue them? No, you don&#39;t have enough time, money, or energy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporation with a good lawyer (Editorial comment: Why bother?):&lt;br /&gt;
Upfront cost = $2-5K&lt;br /&gt;
Monthly fee = $500-2K&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to get people to sign legally binding contracts/not argue that you coerced them into signing something: give them a consideration in return.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: You hired some people but didn&#39;t make them sign confidentiality agreements (because you&#39;re stupid). Now you want them to sign CAs. Give them $500 in exchange (or something); makes it really hard for them to argue afterwards that you forced them into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If someone asks to be on your Board of Advisors, you should say, &#39;No.&#39;&amp;quot; -- JC&lt;br /&gt;
Get impressive and excited people to serve on your Board of Advisors. You should probably have to reach out to them. If they&#39;re on 200 other Boards of Advisors, they won&#39;t do anything for you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fascinating case, not sure about take-aways...&lt;br /&gt;
Sal Khan cited authenticity as the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; of Khan Academy&#39;s success. Other factors: bite-sized content (10-15 minute segments), totally brilliant and interesting presenter (Sal), tutoring vs. teaching model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m worried about their transition to the big time. It seems as if Khan will have serious crossing-the-chasm problems that were not discussed in a way that made me comfortable.\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current user base: privileged high-school/college kids who WANT help learning math and science in a way that supplements formal instruction, without using a real tutor or asking their teachers for help.&lt;br /&gt;
Targeted user base: middle-school kids in underperforming schools who may not want to learn math and science, coordinated through teachers/educational system, where completion/progress through lessons can be monitored.&lt;br /&gt;
How are these the same jobs-to-be-done? Like, at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still an incredibly impressive guy and meaningful mission. I was in awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I waited a long time before I quit my job.&amp;quot; -- Sal Khan&lt;br /&gt;
AND&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I didn&#39;t want to live off my savings for nine months, but it made for a great story.&amp;quot; -- Sal Khan&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>SecondMarket (EF, Wednesday, Week 11)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/wednesday-week-11/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Benefits of an IPO:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Access to equity capital&lt;br /&gt;
-- Liquidity for (1) founders/employees and (2) investors&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Currency&amp;quot; for (1) acquisitions and (2) attracting talented employees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPO market is in decline in last 15 years; small IPO market has basically evaporated. Most transactions used to be &amp;lt;$50M; almost none now. Why? - Change from investment mentality to trading mentality (avg equity holding period: 2 years =&amp;gt; 3 months). Caused by decimalization, rise of high-frequency trading. Makes it less attractive to be public (end up with short-term hedge fund execs on your board), need enough publicly-traded equity to absorb volatility.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Evaporation of small-cap equity research. Caused by regulatory activity (wall between research and banking; no cross-subsidization), acquisition of small-cap investment banks. Decreases demand for small-cap offerings.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Higher direct costs (Sarbanes-Oxley, others). It costs $2.5M to go public and $1.5M per year to stay public (for smaller firms). A lot of smart people think the legislative changes argument is overblown, and that SOX has not been a real deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaways for a growing business looking for a liquidity event:&lt;br /&gt;
Pursue a dual-exit strategy. Prep for an IPO, talk to potential acquirers, think about SecondMarket to establish price for shares (you can always set a floor). Dual-exit =&amp;gt; +25% on acquisition price (on average).&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ventures cut corners on &amp;quot;accredited investor&amp;quot; paperwork in angel rounds. Your investors just have to sign on the dotted line; how are you supposed to know whether they&#39;re actually worth over $2M...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most common &amp;quot;errors&amp;quot; in pro-formas:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Revenue obviously too high in year 4 (or year 5, or whatever).&lt;br /&gt;
-- Profit margin obviously too high in year 4/5 (usually because you didn&#39;t think about new hires required when sales picked up, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random rules of thumb:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Do quarterly pro-forma P&amp;amp;Ls; month is way too hard to check for mistakes and usually just adds false precision.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Increase salaries by 6-8% per year.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Typical commission on sales: 5%.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Average employee salary: $80-90K plus 15% in benefits.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Sales staff cost $100-200K per year, depending on the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tools of Cooperation/John Sculley at Apple (BSSE, Tuesday, Week 11)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/tuesday-week-11/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not sure I agree with a lot of the take-aways, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out where your organization stands, because it will determine (1) how easy it will be to adapt to change and (2) what tools will be effective within the organization:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.saludygestion.com/archives/Tools%20of%20cooperation%20and%20change.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upper-right organizations are resistant to change (Apple in the 80s).&lt;br /&gt;
How does this happen? The causal mechanism for developing a culture is repeated success.&lt;br /&gt;
Similarly, the causal mechanism for breaking down a culture is stress or failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do leaders change an organization that is running fine right now but is not equipped for the future?&lt;br /&gt;
Establish a sense of urgency? Break organization into smaller BUs, set goals, delegate responsibility, cut ruthlessly (standard BSSE answer)?&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s not easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;
Strong argument that Jobs would have sunk the ship just as thoroughly as Sculley/Spindler/Amelio --- Apple needed to experience serious trauma to break down the culture of making &amp;quot;elegant PCs at whatever the cost&amp;quot; (in the words of Gassee). Only on the brink of bankruptcy could a CEO dramatically shift the organization&#39;s priorities...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;
Too deterministic and at odds with everything I have seen about leadership in the actual world. Some people can convince others to do things they would prefer not to do. Other people can&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;
Serious, quantifiable failure is not the only casual mechanism for change (although failure is a great teacher).&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Phil Knight at Nike (FD, Tuesday, Week 11)</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Theories for why some people start massive, profitable companies and still retain control of them (rich and king):&lt;br /&gt;
-- Luck&lt;br /&gt;
-- Lightning strikes (something unusual about the opportunity that they were uniquely equipped to exploit)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Great founder (just something different/superior about Gates, Jobs, Knight, and a few others)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Creative decisions (somehow avoided the typical rich vs. king tradeoff)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Structural (specific industry characteristics that enable rich and king)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity splits between partners:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;51% / 49%&amp;quot; is not a tenable capital structure, and should set off warning bells. How will the 51% guy retain control when the firm must issue new equity for employees or investors? How readily will he give up control?&lt;br /&gt;
Phil Knight basically retained majority/near-majority stake in Nike by bullying a series of early employees into selling their equity to him at shockingly discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homophily is sometimes a strength.&lt;br /&gt;
Nike&#39;s early success was built on the back of unique insight into elite running. But that makes it harder to adapt when the world changes: junior employees foresee the rise of Reebok and aerobics, but can&#39;t effectively communicate to Nike leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cliffs Notes: Maslow is wrong; everyone grasps for actualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things that make people satisfied with their jobs (motivation) are different in kind from the things that make people dissatisfied with their jobs (hygiene).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job security, good salary, fringe benefits, pleasant boss = hygiene =&amp;gt; lack of dissatisfaction&lt;br /&gt;
But more salary doesn&#39;t make people more excited about their job.&lt;br /&gt;
Accountability, new tasks, feedback on performance = motivation/actualization =&amp;gt; satisfaction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaway from Chinese manufacturing plant (variant on Foxconn):&lt;br /&gt;
Formal ecosystems can emerge that are very different from what upper-level management intends. Huge division between direct and indirect labor, serious barriers to bottom-up improvement =&amp;gt; NOT ideal for a self-professed lean manufacturing facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KITA (Kick in the Ass) inspires movement, not motivation. Even positive reinforcement (incentive compensation) only inspires movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do Chinese assembly line workers with tenuous, incredibly desirable jobs break the SOP to increase plant efficiency? They realize no material reward, and they&#39;ll be fired if they&#39;re discovered.&lt;br /&gt;
Answer: Everyone wants self-actualization. Even if their physiological and security needs are not met...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three ten-minute presentations; no formal lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about your Plan B if MVP tests don’t work out. Not the end of the world, but think about how you’d change your business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Monsanto markets GMO crops: lots of users testimonials. “People who are just like you” who realized significant return = powerful motivator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify thought-leaders/influencers in an industry and win them over. If you can’t win them over, your product is probably doomed anyway. Think about how your product would help them (ag schools would love more data on disease outbreaks…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you understand your customers’ motivations.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: Germ fighting product for daycare centers. Seems like a great idea, but daycare centers actually WANT kids to get sick. Sick children still pay for daycare but don’t come to school.&lt;/p&gt;

-- High willingness to pay&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Pharma is basically the only set of institutions capable of doing real biotech patent due-diligence. Independent lawyers are notoriously bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for biotech: VCs vs. Strategic investors vs. Venture philanthropy.&lt;br /&gt;
As with all things, match investor to intended strategic path. VCs care about quick returns and high potential. Strategic investors can lend expertise and provide exit option, but might complicate exit (signaling value if they do not acquire you) and you need at least two in your capital structure to avoid &amp;quot;big company&#39;s captive startup&amp;quot; syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Victor Frankl (author of &amp;quot;Man&#39;s Search for Meaning&amp;quot;):&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;78% of American youngsters are most concerned with finding meaning and purpose in life.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Upshot: most people are not materialistic and grabby, despite appearances.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should be, and he will become as he can and should be.&amp;quot; -- Goethe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why think about a leadership purpose: makes the journey of life meaningful.&lt;br /&gt;
Practical answer =&amp;gt; Without a purpose, why would anyone follow you? Without a purpose that is larger than you, you&#39;re just at the mercy of your ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.&amp;quot; -- George Bernard Shaw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example purposes:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Eliminate chaos!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Broad options for sales: direct sales, indirect sales, OEM, distributors, retailers, Internet, Freemium (&amp;quot;Children&#39;s Crusade&amp;quot; distribution model)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often use different strategies for different customers: direct sales for large customers and distributors for smaller customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rule of thumb: selling cost should be 10-20% of sales (long term). May be much higher initially...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that the distributor is a channel, not the end customer. The consumer STILL must actually buy your product.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: Selling new wetsuits to scuba shops. Purchasing agent for store actually buys the product. But store manager still must pull the product through the channel/convince customer to buy. Need to worry about both of them...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing credibility selling to big customers:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How many people are in your company? Ten? Olive Garden laughs you out of the building. But they do it with all due politeness, because when you&#39;re here, you&#39;re family!&amp;quot; -- Howard Anderson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On founding motivations:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A couple of Wharton students decide that they&#39;re going to start their own company. They live in Silicon Valley, and in Silicon Valley you can&#39;t meet women if you don&#39;t have your own company.&amp;quot; -- Howard Anderson&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Business model decision: IP Licensing vs. OEM =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; answer is probably a mix&lt;br /&gt;
IP Licensing: Less capital intensive/higher margin but more exposed to copying by competitors with deep pockets to fight legal battles. AND the cost of litigation rises with success; truly high-potential innovations inspire more knock-offs.&lt;br /&gt;
OEM: Worse margins, more protection of IP, may be harder to push technology to market (need partnerships; difficult to establish).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criteria for deciding who to partner with/which markets to enter:&lt;br /&gt;
-- High pain = high willingness to pay/suitability of innovation&lt;br /&gt;
-- Non-exclusivity&lt;br /&gt;
-- Internal R&amp;amp;D capability of partner = tradeoff between driving faster adoption/crossing the chasm vs. partner&#39;s ability to innovate around you/cut OEMs out.&lt;/p&gt;

Factors that might enable a tilt towards king =&amp;gt; non-fiduciary boards, investors/donors have fewer forcing mechanisms to influence management, non-monetary results complicate objective assessment of impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earl: Many classmates who said they would join the corporate world to gain relevant experience and then move into non-profit sector to make an impact.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Nine out of 10 people never make it back.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to be involved in non-profit organizations/social justice causes, be careful about postponing participation.&lt;/p&gt;

-- Operating and Maintenance (upfront cost = minimal)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Cost-plus =&amp;gt; good when there is requirement risk; basically a partnership&lt;br /&gt;
-- Up-sell/High margin add-ons (Best Buy and warranties)&lt;br /&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Sales Funnel&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1yqjI-LoGn8/TItsUTdCIEI/AAAAAAAAAAU/yVgvlclOLG4/s320/1.+Sales+funnel&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to generate high-quality leads: no formula; try multiple avenues and measure success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of marketing is to drive leads to your sales force. You can spend a lot of marketing money foolishly if you are not disciplined. Do not confuse activity with progress.&lt;br /&gt;
Orient marketing towards finding &amp;quot;early majority&amp;quot; (in Crossing the Chasm-speak). Otherwise, you&#39;ll need a dramatic shift later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good book: &amp;quot;Inbound Marketing,&amp;quot; Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah (HubSpot guys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HubSpot thesis: the way people shop and learn about products has changed dramatically. New &amp;quot;smarketing&amp;quot; process:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Get found =&amp;gt; create remarkable content; build a website, blog, useful tools, media coverage; start EARLY&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Convert and personalize.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your company should form its own persona!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On buying PPC keywords: figure out how your customers describe the problem (&amp;quot;red bumps on my legs&amp;quot;), not how you describe the problem (&amp;quot;erythema nodosum&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting sales structure right is critical&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/image10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some products are almost un-sellable. Pitching something with $3K of value to dentists = the Valley of Death. Too complex/pricey for no-touch sales model; too cheap for high-touch sales force.&lt;br /&gt;
Solutions: partner with someone else who already sells to that customer; still hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;American search fund: a Mini-LBO. Returns from leverage in acquisition and operational improvements (margin expansion). Growth industry increases likelihood of good exit.&lt;br /&gt;
Mexican search fund: a Mini-VC fund. Not much leverage; too risky to buy bad business and try a turnaround; primarily banking on either top-line growth or operational improvement/multiple expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges with non-American search funds:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Raising capital is hard. Bank debt is expensive or unavailable (niche between small-business loan and full-on LBO).&lt;br /&gt;
-- Macro environment risks. Currency risk for foreign investors, financial statements are unreliable, hard to find comparables for valuation.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Harder to find good targets. Culture resistance to selling businesses.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Investors are harder to find; model is not well understood. Need foreign investors to reassure Americans about the target; need American investors to reassure foreigners about the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisition-stage =&amp;gt; two-sided negotiation with fund investors (selling them on the target and the deal) and with seller. If seller wants a higher price, need to raise more equity =&amp;gt; messy, non-obvious impact on returns for LPs and for searchers. Solutions: seller financing, earn-outs, seller retains some equity stake.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do you actually define &amp;quot;high impact entrepreneurship?&amp;quot; After listening to the founder, I&#39;m still not sure...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting Endeavor Entrepreneurs = balance between potential to blow up, economic progress, and social progress&lt;br /&gt;
Endeavor has basically targeted returns (potential to blow up).&lt;br /&gt;
Sort of like a VC firm, except they appear to make much safer bets (high % of successful ventures) and only pick 10-20 entrepreneurs per country. So they clearly can&#39;t take the same risks as VCs, for whom most bets fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endeavor seems to be doing a lot of good in places where there is no culture of entrepreneurship. And I am impressed. But Brazil was booming before Endeavor --- are they just riding the wave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how I feel about this, or even whether I think Endeavor is achieving something meaningful (versus anointing destined-for-success firms in developing countries and serving as a summer employment option for former consultants in business school who don&#39;t land anything &amp;quot;better&amp;quot;). Endeavor summer hires I have met are not that impressive, aside from having resumes including experience at a bulge-bracket bank/big-3 consulting firm. I am a bit skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;

The project has management buy-in; managed as separate BU; adequate funding; no pressure to fit in to existing profit model; builds product based on customer feedback; delivers on time!; etc. EVERYTHING IS RIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;
Kittyhawk still produces an expensive disk drive, not a cheap one. The project is a miserable failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s class: disruption in HR. I am skeptical...&lt;br /&gt;
Summary: causal mechanism for management success is exposure to previous, &amp;quot;similar&amp;quot; situations (whatever that means).&lt;br /&gt;
Thus, select for past experiences &amp;amp; capacity to learn, not &amp;quot;adjectives&amp;quot; (past results).&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://ash.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/speed-learning-focus.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formula for product dev:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Before you build anything, test against target customers with visuals (storyboards, drawings, prototypes).&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Understand your &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; (sustainable competitive advantage; whatever you&#39;re building your business on the back of).&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Identify most important assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Identify quickest way to test your assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;
This is your Minimum Viable Product.&lt;br /&gt;
If you assemble/test this early, it is much easier and cheaper to pivot. Cost and complexity of pivots increases quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can outsource everything else, but you need to do your &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; functions yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to sell products before you have products:&lt;br /&gt;
Make a product brochure with:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Features (technology)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Functions (how product fits in to customer&#39;s job responsibilities)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Benefits (how product is faster, cheaper, or better than alternatives)&lt;br /&gt;
Then sell vaporware based on your product brochure.&lt;br /&gt;
Only complication: it&#39;s hard to change your product after you&#39;ve sold it. Need to make sure you&#39;re not producing a custom, one-off solution to appeal to a single customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PT Games MVP (Microsoft Kinect for physical therapy/rehab)&lt;br /&gt;
Making a Kinect game as an MVP would have been super-expensive. Alternative?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Make a video of physical therapy, hand out instead of paper directions. Test hypothesis that people will care about/use technology solutions for physical therapy.&lt;br /&gt;
-- If people watch the video, then install webcam to enable physical therapist to watch sessions. Test hypothesis that trainers will care about their clients&#39; compliance/exercise habits.&lt;br /&gt;
-- THEN, only if hypotheses are confirmed, built a basic Kinect game and do iterative testing.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New ventures should be hungry for profit, not hungry for growth. Don&#39;t invest for growth until you&#39;ve nailed your profit formula.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/Slide11.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://colinbarry.com/img/Slide11-300x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Slide1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about Google acquisitions/growth investments (YouTube, setting up 100 on-demand channels, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;
If you think they can easily incorporate these into existing business model, they make a ton of sense (top-right).&lt;br /&gt;
If you think they are emergent opportunities that don&#39;t fit into existing profit formula, they may be foolish (top-left).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing &amp;quot;by the numbers&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; most GMs forced to view every decision through lens of short-term profitability. Revenue drops; all fixed costs like labor become a higher percentage of revenue =&amp;gt; need to do layoffs.&lt;br /&gt;
Managers tread thin line between keeping profitability within acceptable tolerances and planning for revenue growth in the future. If we cut too deep, we may have trouble recovering when macroeconomic conditions (or our technology, or whatever) improve...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggestions: make fixed costs into variable costs (contract labor). Don&#39;t mix dissimilar business models in the same organization; enables profitable biz models to &amp;quot;cover up&amp;quot; losses in unprofitable biz models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common big company formula: &amp;quot;Leash&amp;quot; to invest in new growth initiatives only has slack while the company is making profits. When the core fails, firms&#39; instinct is to cut non-core businesses and retrench around proven core, EVEN THOUGH new growth initiatives will be key to making profits in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
Thus, new growth businesses in big companies need to be hungry for profit before being hungry for growth. Otherwise, they&#39;ll get cut in a downturn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors to examine in valuation:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Growth projections =&amp;gt; Will this venture&#39;s revenues grow like retail (slow) or like Internet retail (fast)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Cash flows =&amp;gt; future CAPEX requirements per strategic plan (not much bricks-and-mortar required), structure of cash flows (negative Operating Working Capital; CSN gets paid before they pay suppliers).&lt;br /&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The people you spend most of your waking hours around (colleagues) may not be well-equipped to give you insightful personal or professional counsel.&lt;br /&gt;
If you do not deliberately cultivate mentors and keep in touch with them, you will not have anyone else to turn to in times of uncertainty.&lt;br /&gt;
Solution: develop a support group.&lt;br /&gt;
When did Noah build the ark? Before the rain.&lt;br /&gt;
High-achieving people are often the worst at cultivating a support group because they can usually plough through challenges alone. And then a huge problem comes along and they need help, but there&#39;s no one to turn to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching difficult problems/asking for help:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Separate need for affirmation from need for counsel.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Share vulnerability. Maintain public confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Wall off the problem&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; Big step in &#39;resilience training&#39; is ability to see the whole forest, and not just the forest fire. Just because you can&#39;t control everything doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t control some things.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: &amp;quot;So I didn&#39;t get the job I wanted, but I still have X and I can still do Y.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tad Piper on formal support groups:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Meet on a regular basis (weekly, monthly, annually)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Someone in charge of the agenda (usually rotating)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Ground rules for group behavior. Example: married couples group agrees not to talk about kids or sports.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurship in Germany (or, why Facebook didn&#39;t start in Munich):&lt;br /&gt;
Cultural reasons:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Stigma about failure in business (deters smart people from attempting high-risk ventures)&lt;br /&gt;
-- No iconic role-models (Who is the German Steve Jobs?)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Conservative mindset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional reasons:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Bankruptcy laws that favor creditors (Can&#39;t just leave the keys to your startup with your creditors and walk away)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Smaller, fragmented public markets =&amp;gt; strategic sale is the only exit option =&amp;gt; strategic buyers drive down valuations&lt;br /&gt;
-- Fewer large institutional investors =&amp;gt; hard to raise VC funds; hard to syndicate investment with fewer investors&lt;br /&gt;
-- More rigid labor markets =&amp;gt; hard to fire non-performers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room for debate about whether the fundamental difference is institutional or cultural; obviously the two are connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare to Silicon Valley. Some huge differences:&lt;br /&gt;
-- California courts have basically invalidated the non-compete clause. Easy to leave Google and start a new venture...&lt;br /&gt;
-- Self-perpetuating system =&amp;gt; smart people cluster around previous successes; infrastructure develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upshot =&amp;gt; European VC investors make stable, predictably profitable investments. Euro VC returns are mean-distributed.&lt;br /&gt;
American VC investors shoot for the moon. Top quartile of American VCs exhibit incredible returns; the rest of the industry performs poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact on inge/What does this mean for entrepreneurs?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Lots of corporate VC (with accompanying benefits and drawbacks) =&amp;gt; large firms using their balance sheets to invest in startups; basically viewed as a substitute for R&amp;amp;D spend&lt;br /&gt;
-- Large disparity between firm&#39;s valuation on a discounted cash-flow basis and valuation from transaction comparables; challenges for entrepreneurs around gaining liquidity&lt;br /&gt;
-- Hard to start capital-intensive businesses =&amp;gt; ventures that might be viable in US have trouble when they need cash to scale up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuation with three-factor FCF model&lt;br /&gt;
-- EBITDA margins =&amp;gt; look at implied fixed vs. variable cost % as reflected in historical financials&lt;br /&gt;
-- Asset intensity =&amp;gt; look at length of sales cycle =&amp;gt; drives OWC needs&lt;/p&gt;

At A123, Yet-Ming Chiang took a one-year sabbatical from MIT to patent tech. Defensible IP enabled the firm to raise capital and build mammoth infrastructure to produce batteries. Without defensive patent portfolio, investors would&#39;ve stayed away --- even though incumbents never seriously pursued legal action AND patents had zero impact on execution.&lt;/p&gt;

-- Capital intensity/development risk --- huge debt and equity required to find out if a firm&#39;s technology will scale&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Khosla buying with early-stage investments?&lt;br /&gt;
A call option on many, many cleantech startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious challenges to cleantech:&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;IPO window&amp;quot; is a fickle thing; large incumbents are not really ready to buy now (Exxon-Mobile is not snapping up promising cleantech startups). =&amp;gt; traditional VC &amp;quot;needs a big sucking sound at the end&amp;quot; of a five-year investment window to enable timely exit&lt;br /&gt;
-- Dearth of late-stage investors ready to sink cash into cleantech to enable firms to scale up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Matheson (Flagship) on the two critical parts of being a VC:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Can your fund make promising bets (and avoid bad bets)?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Can your fund persuade other people to put their own money up alongside yours? Their capital is cheaper...&lt;/p&gt;

Industry experts sometimes able to lend perspective to squabbles; no skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wider world: new venture sees their relationship with VC associate/partner who sits on board.&lt;br /&gt;
They do not see performance of other VC portfolio companies, VC&#39;s internal politics, or VC&#39;s relationship with LPs.&lt;br /&gt;
Result: lots going on in the minds of investors that new venture does not understand.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember, jobs-to-be-done are universal and timeless. Whatever NetFlix is doing for its customers is a job that George Washington had (so it&#39;s not &amp;quot;send them movies.&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s probably something like &amp;quot;What can we do tonight (at home)?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Help me know what I want to do.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Our understanding of the job may increase (we may develop ingenious recommendation algorithms) and the experiences associated with the job may evolve, but the core job doesn&#39;t change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry Ford on why he frequently upgraded the machinery on his production line (apocryphal, via Clay):&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If I don&#39;t buy the newest machines all the time, I&#39;ll wind up paying the full cost anyway due to lower production volume AND I won&#39;t have new machines.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
After some research, I think the real quote --- basically a manager&#39;s critique of the base-case fallacy in financial analysis --- might be:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If a man thinks that his money will earn 5 percent, or 6 percent, he ought to place it where he can get that return, but money placed in a business is not a charge on the business --- or, rather, should not be. It ceases to be money and becomes, or should become, an engine of production, and it is therefore worth what it produces --- and not a fixed sum according to some scale that has no bearing upon the particular business in which the money has been placed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rollover risk is a big danger in financing through balloon loans (and many other LBO-type strategies).&lt;br /&gt;
No one really expects repayment of principal at maturity, but situation can get really sticky if you need to roll over in the middle of a financial crisis --- when absolutely no lending is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colin&#39;s cynical takeaway: Everybody has to pay their debts --- except if they are well-resourced enough to find other people to pay their debts for them.&lt;/p&gt;

About 40% of the Dow-Jones were venture-backed firms; the rest were bootstrapped or angel-backed or financed by banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YCombinator (and other incubators): attract unproven teams that are not far enough along to look for VC funding.&lt;br /&gt;
In current climate, with TONS of aspiring entrepreneurs, incubators perform an important screening function for VCs and angel investors. Bubble? Maybe...&lt;br /&gt;
Also, incubators are a product of the increasing size of VC funds and the rise of super-angels. Nobody in the current ecosystem was willing/able to supply small amounts of capital ($20K) to fund new ventures to reach initial information events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How relevant are incubators to MBA founders? Theoretically don&#39;t need business savvy or institutional credibility as much as ventures with only technical or non-traditional biz founders. Maybe...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Espoused values (aspirational/how you think you should be) vs. lived values (&amp;quot;in use&amp;quot;/patterns of behavior)&lt;br /&gt;
Is it really what you value if you don&#39;t live your life that way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to live your values is to translate them into actionable commitments. If you are content to let values remain fluffy ideals, you will not live them. You will break them.&lt;br /&gt;
Ex. Responsibility &amp;gt; Achievement =&amp;gt; I will not demean my employees or neglect their growth to further my own achievement.&lt;br /&gt;
OR Faith &amp;gt; Ambition =&amp;gt; I will not work or compete in sports on Sundays (Clay Christensen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another technique: find safe places to exercise boundary-following and develop your self-control.&lt;br /&gt;
Ex. If you golf a lot, always play the ball where it lies. Not because taking a free drop is necessarily cheating (if you&#39;re playing casually, it probably isn&#39;t) but because self-control and fortitude are muscles that atrophy with lack of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another technique: Surround yourself with people who value similar things. We have a dangerous tendency to adopt the norms of the people around us.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Typical angel investments:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Small chunk of a new venture that might be huge (i.e. an early-stage investment in the next Google)&lt;br /&gt;
-- A large chunk of a new venture with a mid-size exit (lower risk and 5x upside, not 30x upside)&lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Angels often fund less capital-intensive projects; not as concerned with IRR (like VC) as cash-on-cash returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lean startup vs. &amp;quot;plump&amp;quot; startup: some kinds of business models (cash curve with long tail or deep trough) do not make sense for lean startup-type methodology.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems founding with friends: we think we trust our friends, but it&#39;s a different kind of trust. Trust between friends =&amp;gt; getting along well; looking out for each other Trust between co-workers =&amp;gt; competence; ability to execute Example: Several years ago, Noam&#39;s wife (an OB-GYN) was on the &amp;quot;Boston&#39;s Best Doctors&amp;quot; list. When the list was published, Noam realized that he previously had no objective way to evaluate how good she was at medicine. Obviously she is fabulous (and that&#39;s what he had thought), but he didn&#39;t really have any way to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity means many things: financial upside, motivation to contribute and persist in venture, fairness, referendum on personal worth (?)&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three axes of competition (more useful than just thinking quality vs. price):&lt;br /&gt;
Product excellence/innovation =&amp;gt; Ex. Google =&amp;gt; typically dominated by engineering or product management&lt;br /&gt;
Low price =&amp;gt; Ex. Walmart =&amp;gt; typically dominated by logistics/operations&lt;br /&gt;
Customer intimacy =&amp;gt; Ex. (Old) IBM or Zappos =&amp;gt; typically dominated by sales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How life works in a firm focused on customer intimacy:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If your customer thinks the Wang Laboratories product is better and you can&#39;t convince them otherwise, then you go and you buy the Wang product and you sell it to your customer. But you never, ever let your customer talk to Wang.&amp;quot; -- Bill Aulet on life in IBM&#39;s sales organization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why customer intimacy works:&lt;br /&gt;
The customer may not always think your product is better or cheaper, but they trust that your sales force will ensure that your product does the job and doesn&#39;t break. Also, your customer knows where your sales force lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mixed/unfocused strategies (cheap and high quality!):&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mermaid strategies --- try to do two things and do neither of them well. You&#39;re neither a woman or a fish!&amp;quot; -- Bill Aulet&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How steps in the value chain get modular/commoditized:&lt;br /&gt;
Performance (in terms of functionality and reliability) overshoots customer demand in lower tiers of the market, and the basis of competition in those tiers changes to price. Competition based on price pushes towards modular architecture, which minimizes cost to produce at the expense of performance. Product&#39;s components become the differentiators, product&#39;s manufacturers become component assemblers. When the relevant dimensions of performance are not determined by manufacturers, profits sink to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law of conservation of attractive profits: When modularity and commoditization cause attractive profits to disappear at one stage in the value chain, the opportunity to earn attractive profits with proprietary products will usually emerge at an adjacent stage.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: In personal computer business, the actual assembly of a computer gets commoditized.&lt;br /&gt;
Profits shift upstream to component manufacturers. Some component manufacturers capture profits (Intel). Some get commoditized themselves (RAM producers) and profits shift further upstream to makers of component fabrication equipment (Applied Materials).&lt;br /&gt;
Some profits also shift downstream to firms that integrate across the not-good-enough interface with the customer (Dell&#39;s retailing/logistics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see commoditization coming, think about what piece of value chain you&#39;d like to own.&lt;br /&gt;
Good places to look: customer interface (Dell), components (hard-drive head manufacturers), production machinery (Applied Materials), &amp;quot;recipe&amp;quot;/process for production (Intel)&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;More on three-factor model for valuation: tie assumptions about asset intensity and profit margin to expected changes in business model in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: firm plans expand sales channels from telemarketing to retail stores. Asset intensity will probably increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recapitalization: substituting debt for equity in a firm&#39;s capital structure. Often part of LBOs, but a great option if management/early investors wants some liquidity without selling equity to outsiders, doing an IPO, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing the chasm (technology push business models): look for easiest customer to please. Best customers are well-funded and readily accessible to sales force, with compelling reason to buy. You (and your partners) should ideally be able to deliver a whole product.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about FCF valuation: a function of revenue growth rate (g), profit margin (p), asset intensity ratio (a), and discount rate.&lt;br /&gt;
Tricky part: thinking about asset intensity and profit margin, especially as business model changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset intensity:&lt;br /&gt;
Cash =&amp;gt; separate cash needed to run business (&amp;quot;daily caloric requirement&amp;quot;) from cash lying around (&amp;quot;% body fat).&lt;br /&gt;
Asset intensity = [Fixed Assets + Net Operating Working Capital] / Sales&lt;br /&gt;
NOWC = (Current Assets + Deferred Receivables -- Cash) -- (Current Liabilities + Deferred Revenues -- Debt)&lt;br /&gt;
Basically, combines NWC and fixed assets. Subscription-type business models generally have low or negative asset intensity. Manufacturing has high asset intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forecasting into the future: as much guesswork as science. Try to tie to expected business realities --- if we have to hire an enterprise sales force and accept a long sales cycle, asset intensity will go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check your math/gain insight into investors&#39; thought process: back out investors&#39; rate of return in likely states of the world. If the firms gets acquired for $200mn in five years, what will rate of return be for Round A investors? This will drive most of their decision-making/preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Venture Debt =&amp;gt; Interest (more than bank loans) + Warrants (less than VC) + Option for investment in future rounds (like VC)&lt;br /&gt;
Typically 3.5 year loans with 1% interest due per month. Borrower starts principal payments after 6 mo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purpose: another 4-6 mo of &amp;quot;runway&amp;quot; for venture. Not much dilution; enough cash to get to the next milestone/round of funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good venture debt providers are not super-worried about repayment.&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#39;t think about it like a 30-year mortgage on a house; it&#39;s a loan to get venture to the next round of financing. As long as firm lands a B Round, the venture debt provider gets repaid. And good VCs in the A Round almost always means that there will be a B Round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly: Series B is probably riskier for venture debt provider than Series A. Less certainty that there will be a Series C...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Integration vs. modularity =&amp;gt; driven by (1) the basis of competition in an industry and (2) maturity of technology/business model.&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Are players competing on price or quality (because it&#39;s hard to be &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; to satisfy customers)?&lt;br /&gt;
(2) How well-defined is the problem and the solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Apple iPhone&#39;s interdependent architecture wins because competition centers around basic capabilities. Competitors could not provide remotely adequate customer experience without integration across hardware, OS, apps, music, and video. Problem: HTML 5 and other developments that might enable &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; performance without high degree of integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does modularity destroy profits? Maybe, but probably just shifts profits around the value chain.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: PC performance improves to meet minimum threshold; most components become modular (memory, hard drive, DVD drive, etc.). Profits shift to processor (Intel), OS (Microsoft), software (Microsoft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trend: interdependent products become modular. But it&#39;s hard to figure out when &amp;quot;the time is ripe.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Example: Boeing Dreamliner. Boeing attempted to outsource design/manufacture of almost all components. Technology problems are poorly understood, high minimum threshold for performance. Boeing ends up with hydraulic lines that do not meet, wing surfaces that do not fit together. The Dreamliner arrives four years late and $15bn over budget.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In very early stage, think about what hypotheses need to be true for your new venture to succeed. Usually three buckets:&lt;br /&gt;
– technology works&lt;br /&gt;
– customers want it&lt;br /&gt;
– customers can pay for it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for ways to quickly test these hypotheses with existing data. Example: Do people care about weather forecasts? How many times a day does the average smartphone user check the weather?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent priorities: figure out criteria under which you would walk away from idea and criteria that would make idea really exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t spend lots of time chasing after an idea that the market doesn’t appear to value. You may be able to make it work, get the IP, etc. But what is opportunity cost of six months of your time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vesting is a hard conversation to have (sort of like a pre-nuptial) but incredibly important. Even if only because the future is unpredictable (Georg ended up not getting a visa; unable to continue as co-founder through no fault of his own).&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Technology transfer from universities: be very careful that you are getting terms that make sense for your firm. Patent licenses with a lot of fixed fees attached make sense for large pharma companies, but are the kiss of death for small biotech firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founders agreements are useful for articulating expectations between founders and outlining early-stage plans, but will be nullified/re-negotiated as soon as your firm gets a first round of funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The longer an executive negotiates his employment agreement, the shorter his tenure at a company.&amp;quot; -- Lawyer-guest in EF&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#39;t spend a ton of time entrenching yourself in an enterprise; it is counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lens to think about deals =&amp;gt; How will this impact your future ability to:&lt;br /&gt;
-- Raise money&lt;br /&gt;
-- Conduct an IPO&lt;br /&gt;
-- Get purchased by a strategic buyer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporate early. Don&#39;t be too loose with equity.&lt;br /&gt;
If you wait to distribute equity until your firm is ready to receive funding, equity distribution will have painful personal tax implications. Give out equity early while it is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#39;t set aside massive option pools. Pools count as outstanding shares, and basically decrease a firm&#39;s pre-money valuation from management&#39;s perspective. You can always figure out how to increase the size of an option pool when you want to hire someone useful.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When a firm conducts an IPO, the firm must &amp;quot;register&amp;quot; its equity-holders with the SEC to allow them to publicly trade their stock. Registration is somewhat costly, and only the firm can do it. Thus, most term sheets include clauses relating to registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early-stage investors like angels need to worry about how subsequent rounds of financing will impact their stake in a firm. Later-round investors must permit management to retain equity in the firm for incentive reasons; without upside, management would just leave. The same logic does not apply to previous investors. In the absence of good protection measures, early investors will often get &amp;quot;crammed down&amp;quot; --- especially in later &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; rounds.&lt;br /&gt;
But contractual terms only go so far. Especially arduous terms imposed in early rounds that would deter subsequent investment usually get re-negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major takeaways: Don&#39;t trust term sheets you don&#39;t understand. Use lawyers, and spend a few hours to model payouts and control rights in various states of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A population can evolve, but the individuals within it do not.&amp;quot; -- Clay&lt;br /&gt;

(1) Find all the people who have been at firm for 10+ years, and ask them:&lt;br /&gt;
-- What do you value most about this company? =&amp;gt; culture&lt;br /&gt;
-- Who do you turn to when you have a problem? =&amp;gt; critical people; usually not reflected on org chart&lt;br /&gt;

Sergey Bubka broke the world record for the pole vault 21 consecutive times during his 20-year career, each time by a centimeter.&lt;br /&gt;
Was this what Daimler-Benz had in mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a myriad set of ways that investors (VC or PE funds) capture pieces of the pie that they would not appear to merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deal terms have a price. It is worth considering what that price is.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If the seller set the price and I could negotiate the terms, we could always come to a deal. So the owner got his $2mn. He just got it a different way, over a different period of time.&amp;quot; -- Jim Sharpe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firms often cite &amp;quot;understanding our customers&amp;quot; as a key strength. Two things this can mean:&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Understanding&amp;quot; as a noun = a bunch of institutional knowledge = a Resource&lt;br /&gt;
-- &amp;quot;Understanding&amp;quot; as a verb = procedures for monitoring our customers and determining what they care about/how they make money = a Process&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most founding teams decide on equity split within a month of venture&#39;s launch. About half of teams split equity equally or near-equally.&lt;br /&gt;
Obvious follow-up questions: correlation between either decision and success of venture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware (beware?) of &amp;quot;commitment&amp;quot; to venture turning into &amp;quot;obligation&amp;quot; to venture (or employees or customers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding ways to renew your motivation is important.&lt;br /&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Analyzing disruptive business models is graphing margin (y-axis) over time (x-axis) by customer segment/market (z-axis).&lt;br /&gt;
Usually margin is related to quality or level of service --- in the steel industry, y-axis should be quality of steel. In the medical imaging industry, y-axis should be clarity of image.&lt;br /&gt;
But going up the y-axis means increasing margin.&lt;br /&gt;
Good example (courtesy of HBR):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/images/chart_2270.gif&quot; alt=&quot;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/images/chart_2270.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, incumbents can spin out disruptive innovations in separate business units. There are still huge headaches --- it&#39;s hard to run an organization containing two separate salesforces that sometimes steal customers from each other.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: EMC (high-end product) and Data General (low-end product) merger.&lt;br /&gt;
Solution: Find someone else with worse margins to sell one of your products. EMC licensed Dell to sell their low-end product. Dell was thrilled to be hawking low-end IT infrastructure products (which have much better margins than their core PC business). Removes salesforce conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Homophily (&amp;quot;birds of a feather flock together&amp;quot;): how an e-ticketing startup launches with 75% HBS MBAs as founders, none of whom have ticketing or fundraising or software development experience. People select team members who are similar to them. Beware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early equity split: attract better co-founders.&lt;br /&gt;
Late equity split: more information about co-founders&#39; commitment level and how much they will contribute to the enterprise&#39;s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shooting for the stars&amp;quot; (pitching the best VCs and the biggest-name customers) can help attract a great team, but adds pressure to deliver fast. Smartix fell apart because they could not immediately hit home runs.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>BP and the Consolidation of the Oil Industry (ENERGY, Wednesday, Week 2)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/wednesday-week-2-5/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Capital markets function inefficiently for oil companies. One of the factors driving consolidation of massive integrated oil companies (IOCs) has been liquidity constraints; access to capital has been a serious driver of M&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertical integration (BP buying Amoco to add refining and retailing) has helped eliminate hold-up problems that could not be realistically solved by contractual obligation, even in countries with court systems. In concentrated industries, there is no substitute for owning your channel partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the energy business offers a fascinating set of game-theory-esque case studies. National Oil Companies (NOCs) like Saudi Aramco own refineries in the U.S. basically so that they have enough collateral for American companies to seize (via the U.S. court system) in the event of contractual breach. The insane costs that (for example) Amoco could impose by ceasing to buy oil from BP --- even temporarily --- have impelled consolidation to ensure that upstream firms (exploration and extraction) will have access to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empirically, expropriation (when the Venezuelan government nationalizes extraction) doesn&#39;t really hurt IOC revenues. NOCs still need technical help with extracting oil, access to the consumers, and often access to capital --- try floating a huge bond issue on the international capital markets if you are Angola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And BP/Amoco/ARCO&#39;s play to &amp;quot;short the West Coast markets and elevate prices&amp;quot; in 2000 by shipping Alaskan oil to Asia is possibly the coolest nefarious corporate plot in recent history. An American company tried to manipulate oil prices the world&#39;s eighth largest economy (California) and almost got away with it!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Merrill Lynch/RPP Model (BSSE, Wednesday, Week 2)</title>
		<link href="https://colinbarry.com/posts/wednesday-week-2-4/"/>
		<updated>2011-09-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://colinbarry.com/posts/wednesday-week-2-4/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The RPP model for thinking about firms:&lt;br /&gt;
Resources = people, technology, equipment, cash = &amp;quot;what we have&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Processes = &amp;quot;what we do&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Priorities = &amp;quot;the formula we use to create profit&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key question: Is our past success due to the resources or the processes?&lt;br /&gt;
Contemporary example: Steve Jobs is leaving Apple. Is Apple doomed? If their success is due to resources --- Steve Jobs&#39; innate ability to make products that blow up --- then they will have to replace a unique resource, which will be hard. If their success is due to processes --- a set of linkages and workflows that generate products that blow up --- then they might not have to replace much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no disruptive technologies, only disruptive business models. Even technologies that would appear to completely &amp;quot;change the game&amp;quot; can often be integrated into a firm&#39;s existing processes and priorities --- as sustaining innovations.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: Merrill Lynch and the dawn of the Internet. Merrill initially stays out of online brokerage game/robust customer portal game and uses the web to give wealth managers and other employees better data on their clients&#39; positions, demographics, etc. Its customers aren&#39;t really lured in by $10 transaction fees; they&#39;re not looking to save a few bucks per trade. A sustaining innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

-- Bias for action =&amp;gt; rash, ill-considered&lt;br /&gt;

		<title>USX: Low-End Disruption (BSSE, Tuesday, Week 2)</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jobs to be done&amp;quot; model. Starbucks does two jobs:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Caffeine, stat! (fast, good, consistent coffee)&lt;br /&gt;
(2) A place to sit down and talk with friends, think, or get work done. Starbucks was much cheaper for the customer than the previous alternatives (restaurants).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizational processes/structure makes decisions for the firm. Unilever rotates promising managers every 18-24 months to give them experience in many functional areas. How can they hold managers accountable for consequences over long time horizons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board meetings are convened &amp;quot;on the back deck of the ship.&amp;quot; A firm&#39;s board only sees &amp;quot;the wake&amp;quot; --- lagging indicators of performance. Think about how to find and track leading indicators (lowest-marginal customers, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Data is heavy.&amp;quot; Managers&#39; natural tendency is to attempt to solve problems, not surface them. Thus, good data on performance/challenges does not tend to rise to the top of organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Demand destruction:&amp;quot; if oil prices get too high, consuming nations like the US explore alternative fuels (natural gas) and implement policy measures to decrease consumption (emissions standards). These policy measures do not tend to be reversed when oil prices fall. Thus, oil producers have an interest in maintaining a price ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saudis have 18 percent of the world&#39;s oil reserves and the lowest marginal cost of production on earth. Their marginal cost to produce oil is estimated at $2-5 per barrel. This puts them in a position to act as an enforcer if other producers (especially in OPEC nations) export too much oil. If the Saudis have excess capacity, they can &amp;quot;turn on the taps&amp;quot; and flood the market, making it unprofitable for every other player to produce oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barring a major global catastrophe, standards of living will rise for a large number of people in developing nations in the next 20 years. Under most reasonable forecasts, demand for oil will skyrocket as automobiles become accessible for the upper class in places like China and India. It is totally conceivable that global appetite for oil will increase from around 80mn barrels/day to 130mn barrels/day by 2030. It is not clear that oil production can match demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is at least circumstantial evidence for a weak &amp;quot;peak oil&amp;quot; hypothesis. Beginning in 2004, the correlation between oil prices and production begins to unravel. Simply put, we would expect oil producers to respond to higher prices by quickly increasing production (and capacity). This has not really happened.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When am I ready to found a company?&amp;quot; is an incredibly hard question to answer.&lt;br /&gt;
Argument for waiting: Gaining experience increases domain expertise, leadership skills, credibility, and self-confidence (maybe).&lt;br /&gt;
Argument for founding ASAP: But I can learn all these things on the job! I learn quickly, and I know a lot about myself!&lt;br /&gt;
Counterargument: Everyone thinks they learn quickly and know a lot about themselves. People are notoriously bad judges of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry Nalls&#39; contention: Don&#39;t ever start a company without sales experience. Don&#39;t start a company straight out of business school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you know you&#39;re going to take a hit when the case protagonist --- who has been sitting in on the class discussion --- opens his personal monologue with, &amp;quot;Where&#39;s Colin?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I still think there are inherent challenges for new enterprises with hyper-sales-oriented founders. A summer at athena taught me that you need to pick your client commitments wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good way to think about designing a disruptive business model: chronologically order sub-steps in the existing activity (investment banking/IPO activity: (1) design an S-1, (2) assess potential/price of offering, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;
Then think about how your model can replace or eliminate of one or more steps to drive down price or sell to a new market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratan Tata: Tata can respond to disruption because the corporate umbrella is private, even though some of the component firms are part/fully public. In the US, pressure for ROIC makes management unable to fight disruptive entrants by accepting lower margins or incubating separate low-margin businesses (a la Dayton Hudson incubating Target).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clay&#39;s advice for big established firms: Look at the bottom of your market --- the lowest-margin segment of your business. If you see a new entrant gaining traction, you should quickly buy it and keep it separate from the rest of your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting question: Why don&#39;t McDonalds or Holiday Inn ever move up-market? And how do we explain why no one has disrupted Gucci? Clay&#39;s not sure.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe it&#39;s hard to devise innovative business models in the upper end of the market?&lt;/p&gt;
