      "content_html": "<p>I am a single man in my late 20s. I run marathons for fun, I don't have any chronic diseases, and I am financially stable. And I avoid unnecessary doctor-visits at all costs. This is starting to sound like an eHarmony dating profile...</p>\n<p>Basically, I expect to consume almost no healthcare next year, and I am insuring against the unlikely possibility that I contract a serious and expensive disease like cancer. All things being equal, I would prefer a PPO --- in the unlikely event that I get leukemia, I'd rather go to the oncologist I want instead of the oncologist who is cheapest for my insurer.</p>\n<p>So my healthcare needs are relatively easy to model.<br />\nI pay a premium out every paycheck. If I consume healthcare, I will probably pay --- depending on which plan I choose, I'll pay the first $500 or so of my medical costs, after which my insurer will pay most or all of the rest.</p>\n<p>The most basic choice is a simple HMO vs. a simple PPO.<br />\nThere are some differences in emergency room and prescription drug benefits between these two choices, but they appear relatively immaterial.<br />\nWe can model how much I would pay under each plan in a variety of states of the world:<br />\n<a href=\"https://colinbarry.com/img/singleguy1.png\"><img src=\"https://colinbarry.com/img/singleguy1-1024x591.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"singleguy1\" /></a>How to read this: If my healthcare in 2012 costs the amount on the x-axis, I will pay the amount on the y-axis. So if I consume $600 worth of healthcare, I'll pay about $1,800 with an HMO and $3,800 with a PPO (both in-network).</p>\n<p>Major discovery: I will pay about $2,000 per year for the option of out-of-network coverage.<br />\nWorth it? Probably not.</p>\n<p>The plot thickens when we consider the more complicated PPO plan, which includes a Health Savings Account.<br />\nThe quick and dirty version: if I agree to pay for more of my healthcare upfront ($1500 deductible versus $500), I get a savings account that I can only spend on healthcare.<br />\nMy employer will contribute $375 per year to this account, and I can put in up to $3,100 every year, tax free. It works a lot like retirement account (investment options, early withdrawal penalties, etc. etc.). And in return for accepting more risk that I will have to foot the bill for minor healthcare stuff myself, I pay dramatically lower premiums.</p>\n<p>The employer-contribution angle looks interesting --- my employer subsidizes my healthcare spending to the tune of $375.<br />\nThe tax-free part looks more interesting.<br />\nI am fortunate enough to pay a relatively high marginal tax rate (33%), so the prospect of shielding some of my income from taxes is attractive. If you know of another way to get a 33% riskless return in a year, please drop me an email.</p>\n<p>The tax-shield makes an HSA slightly complicated to analyze. I can afford to save at least $3K per year and I am fairly sure I will spend down my HSA at some point in the future when I have real healthcare expenses. So I will ignore the various constraints on using an HSA, and only examine the tax implications of contribution.</p>\n<p>The more complex PPA+HSA plan turns out to be better than a plain-jane PPO in every case (strongly Paredo-optimal, if you are as big a stats nerd as me). It's also cheaper than an HMO if I consume minimal healthcare next year:<br />\n<a href=\"https://colinbarry.com/img/singleguy2.png\"><img src=\"https://colinbarry.com/img/singleguy2-1024x591.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"singleguy2\" /></a>If I am willing to save the maximum ($3,100 per year), the complicated PPO is cheaper than an HMO in any scenario. Even if I spend a bundle on healthcare, I can still save $500 over managed care.</p>\n<p>So the plan that offer the best care (PPO + HSA) is actually substantially cheaper for me.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>This week, I returned to the working world after a two-year hiatus (vacation?) at the Harvard Business School.<br />\nOne of the myriad shocks of resuming full-time employment was that I now have to PAY for medical care. Ridiculous, I know.</p>\n<p>I am fortunate enough to work at a fabulous, progressive healthcare software firm that offers its employees a choice of health insurance plans administered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, my state's largest insurer.</p>\n<p>I'm afforded the opportunity to choose between three plans --- an HMO (they pick the doctors), a PPO (basically, pays 80% when you visit out-of-network doctors), and a more gnarly PPO with provisions for a Health Savings Account --- a sort of 401(K) plan for healthcare expenses.</p>\n<p><em>Cue &quot;the paradox of choice&quot;</em><br />\nOn my first day of work, a plethora of paper slips and brochures and supplemental booklets (really --- dead trees!) explained the benefits afforded under each plan.<br />\nThere were lots of tables and footnotes and appendices.<br />\nI had no idea which plan to choose.</p>\n<p>But wait, you ask: how is this possible?<br />\nColin, you worry about healthcare for a living! (actually, healthcare information technology --- but whatever)<br />\nHow can you be totally bewildered by something as simple as how to insure yourself?<br />\nI wondered this as well.</p>\n<p>After I got over my initial feelings of shame, I started thinking about my bank account.<br />\nIn most matters I am a ridiculous cheapskate --- so I decided I should probably understand what I was buying.<br />\nAnd because I am an MBA, &quot;understand what I was buying&quot; usually means a bunch of spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel.<br />\nSo without further ado, a several-part analysis of my health insurance options.</p>\n<p>My options appear (based on some cursory and admittedly quick research) to be relatively typical of people employed by mid-sized companies in New England.</p>\n<p>A caveat: I know a little something about exchanging clinical healthcare data. I am far from an expert in the insurance side of healthcare. I am not licensed to dispense advice about insurance decision-making. I have no particular desire to become a credible advisor on individual health insurance.<br />\nSo take my analysis with many grains of salt. If you buy healthcare based on a blog post, you're completely insane. Think about your particular situation yourself.</p>\n<p><em>Background</em><br />\nAn HMO-style plan typically offers low premiums and a low deductible ($500), and assigns the patient to a primary-care physician. HMOs make it extremely expensive to visit out-of-network doctors --- generally, you'll pay out of pocket --- and attempt to deter emergency room visits in all but the most dire of circumstances.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a PPO-style plan offers higher premiums and higher deductibles, but enable the patient more choice in picking doctors. The payer reimburses visits to out-of-network physicians at some pre-determined rate --- if you pick your own orthopedic surgeon, you'll pay 20% of the cost and the insurance company will pay 80%.</p>\n<p>Effectively, PPO insurance is buying an option --- if you have some complex medical problem and you want treatment from the best doctor in your area, the insurance company will still pick up most of the tab.<br />\nAlso, PPOs generally involve less &quot;hassle&quot; --- if you fall down the stairs and you know you broke your leg, you can go straight to an orthopedic surgeon without first visiting a primary-care doc to confirm that, yes, your leg is actually broken.</p>\n",

Overview, business model, accounting analysis, financial analysis, valuation.<br />\n-- Business analysis informs financial analysis; differentiate between financial and non-financial metrics. It's hard to analyze a company if you have no clue how they actually make money.<br />\n-- Compare accounting policies across peer companies; investigate differences.<br />\n-- Read footnotes, always.<br />\n-- Identify assumptions, construct scenarios, do sensitivity analysis. Otherwise, you don't know what's actually an important assumption...<br />\n-- Markets make mistakes. Just objectives; it happens.<br />\n-- Just because it's good and correct and legal accounting doesn't mean you shouldn't change it to do valuation. Example: Company X goes from owning 49% of a subsidiary to 51%. It consolidates the subsidiaries results on its financial statements and revenue increases by 40% between one year and the next. Good accounting? Yes, that's how GAAP works. Useful for valuation purposes/analyzing operating performance? No way.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Accounting standards for when/how to recognize uncertain liabilities are highly subjective (unlike rules for, say, when to use a capital vs. operating lease).<br />\nKey factors: liability is probable, size of liability can be reasonably estimated.<br />\nAlso, &quot;The Contingent Liabilities&quot; would be a great name for a band.</p>\n<p>Big picture differences between measuring contingent liabilities under US GAAP and IFRS:<br />\nGAAP = &quot;best estimate&quot; of a liability --- so the outcome with the highest probability<br />\nIFRS = probability-weighted average (think about it as if you could securitize the liability), discount to a present value. Each period, recognize interest expense on value of principle and accrued interest.</p>\n<p>In the case of Intel, real challenges because the nature of the flaw is known but management policy will determine the size of the liability.<br />\nKey uncertainty: Return rate on flawed Pentiums is unknown. But we can probably estimate it...</p>\n<p>Impact on valuation:<br />\nManagers usually want to be conservative (err on the side of larger liability). Why?<br />\nTake a big hit early, only reach into the &quot;cookie jar&quot; once. Label the hit to earnings as &quot;one-time restructuring&quot; and avoid future guesses/downward expectations.</p>\n",

      "title": "A Cacophony of Voices: The Product Manager in B2B (LTV Blog Post #2)",
      "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>The product manager role is demanding and complicated.</p>\n<p>- &quot;The Product Manager,&quot; Jeffrey Bussgang, Thomas Eisenmann, Robert Go</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://colinbarry.com/img/bidding.jpg\"><img src=\"https://colinbarry.com/posts/ltv/images/bidding.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"bidding\" /></a> Our case mix in LTV was heavily weighted towards consumer Internet startups, with the expectation that the lessons we learned would be broadly generalizable across other business models and industries. I think this has been largely true, but I think product management in B2B firms offers several unique challenges and requires some different skills than are required in B2C. Our discussion of OPOWER touched on some of these challenges, which I believe mostly arise because:</p>\n<p><strong>The User Isn't the Customer.</strong> In the majority of our case discussions -- and in most B2C plays -- the person buying the product and the person using the product are either the same or closely aligned. This was true even for B2B ventures like RentJuice -- realtors who would actually use the product on a daily basis were the key decision-makers in RentJuice's selling process.</p>\n<p>When the user is the customer, there is (at least in theory) a direct correlation between solving your users' problems and selling your product. But in many B2B purchases, the Decision-Making Unit is larger and may lack perfect alignment about what features are desirable. Sometimes critical decision-maker will not actually use the product at all!</p>\n<p>This past summer, I was a product manager for a cloud-based medical records application. The app's primary users were doctors and nurses, who generally held very strong opinions about what features were desirable in a product they used for hours every day. They cared a great deal about qualities like design and ease of use. But the product was usually purchased by C-level executives at medical practices or hospitals, who cared far more about things like the cost of on-boarding new doctors.</p>\n<p>Which of these desires gets prioritized? And who is the real customer here -- the people who use the product or the people who decide to buy it? Balancing the needs of multiple constituencies can get even more complicated when:</p>\n<p><strong>The Customer Wants Conflicting Things.</strong> Clearly different types of users desire different things from a product -- my former i-banker friend wants Excel to work as fast as possible with no visible user interface; I want Excel to walk me through creating pivot tables and most charts with a wizard. Excel can probably satisfy both of us by creating customizable preferences, which my i-banker friend can tweak appropriately. But sometimes different types of users want things are orthogonally opposed.</p>\n<p>A startup founded by one of my friends launched a web-based timesheet application (think Kronos). He has continually encountered variants on a single tradeoff: hourly workers want a timesheet that is simple and quick to use, but accounting departments want a timesheet that is complex and detailed. My friend has done some really cool things with technology to try to make his product generate rich reporting with little input from hourly workers. But figuring out what ongoing improvements would be desirable frequently becomes a delicate balancing act.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I don't think this challenge is unique to B2B -- we've studied consumer-facing firms that managed several-sided markets or diverse sets of stakeholders (Rent the Runway and Mochi Media, for example). But I think the use cases/user stories in B2B products lend themselves to conflict and compromise far more often than in B2C settings.</p>\n<p>One reason: businesses often &quot;hire&quot; software to mediate interactions between different internal functions/groups. If these groups were completely on the same page to begin with, they probably wouldn't need sophisticated software to manage their interactions.</p>\n<p><strong>So What?</strong> I think the upshot is that product managers in B2B settings face particular challenges in channeling the voice of the customer. I've focused this post on enterprise software because it is an area of personal interest and familiarity, but I think similar problems arise for PMs in other technology-focused sectors. So how do PMs deal?</p>\n<p>Ben Foster offered up one solution during our class on OPOWER. Although his firm sells its product to some of the largest and most regulation-bound businesses in America (utility companies), his product organization regards the end user -- consumers paying for electrical power -- as the customer. Ben asks the utilities who actually buy OPOWER to &quot;allow us to focus on the consumer on your behalf.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ben's methodology seems like a great fix -- basically turning OPOWER into a B2C firm for product management purposes and focusing on a single set of stakeholders. But this is not an approach that will work for every B2B firm. My friends' timesheet app, for example, has two customer voices. He must listen to both, and incorporate features that some users don't want.</p>\n<p>For ventures like his, I suspect the best solutions start with good customer discovery but require establishing organizational priorities around which users matter most and where the product can make compromises -- product principles, according to our note on product management. I think B2B startups will need such principles far earlier than B2C ventures, and their thoughtful articulation will be critical to the success of managing the product.</p>\n",

      "title": "Are We There Yet: Thinking Through Product/Market Fit (LTV, Blog Post #1)",
      "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://colinbarry.com/img/Are-We-There-Yet.jpg\"><img src=\"https://colinbarry.com/img/Are-We-There-Yet-300x221.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Are-We-There-Yet\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Startups occasionally ask me to help them evaluate whether they have achieved product/market fit. It's easy to answer: if you are asking, you're not there yet.&quot; -- Eric Ries, &quot;The Lean Startup&quot; (pg 220)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Context</strong><br />\nHypothesis-driven entrepreneurship --- epitomized by Eric Ries' Lean Startup methodology --- has become all the rage among aspiring tech founders. It's not hard to see why. Ries' focus on customer discovery and iterative development addresses a dangerous problem in the two established paradigms for building software.</p>\n<p>Waterfall product development presumes that the problem and the solution are known, and we just have to build the solution in an efficient, staged manner. Agile product development admits that the solution is unknown, but still presumes that the problem is known --- the &quot;voice of the customer&quot; (usually the product manager) will recognize useful software when she sees it. But actually, Lean Startup tells us, the problem is usually unknown, too: it takes ingenuity, guts, and contact with customers <shudder> to determine whether software is useful or not.</shudder></p>\n<p><strong>The Problem</strong><br />\nOkay, so we admit that we're in the land of the blind, and we need to be disciplined and systematic about figuring out what problem we should be solving. But how do we know when we've got the right problem paired with the right solution?</p>\n<p>Ries tells us that the watershed condition is product/market fit --- we've looped through the Build-Measure-Learn process, improving all the while, until we've built an &quot;engine of growth&quot; (by which Eric appears to mean a product with rapidly accelerating user acquisition). Then, we just add fuel and watch the engine go.</p>\n<p>The trouble is that a whole bunch of phenomenally successful and (purportedly) Lean startups slowed down rapid product development iteration --- basically, decided that the product was mostly done --- well before they had anything resembling an engine of growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong><br />\nThe lack of rigor around what constitutes product/market fit makes successfully applying Lean methodology much harder. One of our class guests, David Skok, has written brilliant expositions on constructing a repeatable, scalable sales model. He opened our class discussion with a graphic (roughly):<br />\n<a href=\"https://colinbarry.com/img/skok1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://colinbarry.com/img/skok1.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"skok\" /></a></p>\n<p>But wait, my business only has product/market fit if I already have a sustainable user acquisition model --- ideally an engine of growth so powerful that just a small quantity of &quot;fuel&quot; causes users to crash my webservers and beat down the front door to my startup's office in desperate mad dash to consume my product.</p>\n<p>But it seems to me that my venture has probably already figured out the marketing and sales part of the equation if that is occurring.<br />\nAnd many (if not most) successful startups do appear to delineate building a product from building a sales model.</p>\n<p>Two examples in brief (one cribbed from David Skok):<br />\n-- Airbnb enters YCombinator with a product they have already trialled at SXSW and the Democratic National Convention. They expect to do a ton of development in YC. Paul Graham tells the founders to stop building product, hop a plane to New York City (where they have the most adoption), and personally snap prettier photos of the apartments currently listed on Airbnb.<br />\nScalable? No way.<br />\nDid the market tell them to do this? Nope (at least I don't think so).<br />\nDid it work? Yes. Prospective renters and couch-surfers had been turned off by ugly descriptions of the listed apartments. Success.</p>\n<p>-- Constant Contact completes product development (in the words of David Skok, has found product/market fit). But prospective customers aren't buying.<br />\nIn fact, prospective customers (small businesses in Atlanta) aren't sure why they would need mass-mailing software in the first place. Constant Contact distributes wire-bound books for small businesses to use as visitor books to record shoppers' e-mail addresses.<br />\nA month later, Constant Contact's prospective customers have hundreds of e-mail addresses, and now they need mass-mailing software. Success.</p>\n<p>We can tell similar stories for startups like JBoss, RentJuice, and Dropbox.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I don't think David is wrong in making a distinction in the startup lifecycle between product development and marketing/sales. I think Lean Startup makes it difficult to tell when to stop focusing primarily on building product and start focusing primarily on selling product.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong><br />\nOne possibility (maybe what Eric would argue) is that I've defined the &quot;product&quot; part of &quot;product/market fit&quot; too narrowly. The product is not just a piece of software but rather the startup as a whole --- a product-marketing-sales-PR conglomeration that must be tuned and operating in harmony.</p>\n<p>I'm not so sure. There is a natural tension between Lean-style product development and marketing/sales.<br />\nIn Lean product development, we tirelessly labor to determine what the customer will use and then build something viable and desirable. If the customer tells us (by his or her behavior) that a feature should be different, we change. We pull the product out of the market.</p>\n<p>In sales and marketing, we tirelessly labor to convince the customer that they should use or buy what we already have. If the customer tells us that a feature should be different, we generally try to convince him or her that we know better. We push the product onto the market. And ideally, the customer doesn't require much convincing.</p>\n<p>Lean Startup methodology needs a better definition of product/market fit than &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it\">I know it when I see it</a>.&quot; Maybe arbitrary standards like 40% net promoter score make the most sense. Perhaps we just admit that user acquisition growth is not the right metric for many startups, especially those that require higher-touch sales models. Regardless, I think we need to take a deeper look at what goal we're actually chasing if we're running lean.</p>\n",

(Rob)<br />\n-- Don't give out data at the very start --- peoples' eyes glaze over<br />\nBUT if you can't touch/see the product, you need data early. (Daymond)<br />\n-- If you have a less tangible or B2B venture, you need a more eloquent/emotional pitch. (Rob)<br />\n-- Captivate, but don't stretch the limits of credibility.

(Noam)<br />\n-- Cuban tries to turn an auction into a negotiation. Terrible for the entrepreneurs. Best response: find a way to keep Cuban in the auction. &quot;Mark, I am flattered by your offer etc. but I think you wouldn't actually want me to take a deal like this if I was running a business with your money.&quot;</p>\n<p>Why Daymond offer to buy entrepreneurs out for $300K:<br />\n-- Thought they'd be bad partners/managers.<br />\n-- Intended to take licenses and distribution agreement and run business himself...because he'd probably end up doing that anyway.<br />\nTakeaway: Think about how some offers reveal the motivations of prospective investors. (Noam)</p>\n<p>The best entrepreneurs on <em>Shark Tank</em>, according to Mark Cuban:<br />\n-- Know product, company, and industry cold.<br />\n-- The real test is Q&amp;A, not the pitch.

      "content_html": "<p>How steps in the value chain get modular/commoditized:<br />\nPerformance (in terms of functionality and reliability) overshoots customer demand in lower tiers of the market, and the basis of competition in those tiers changes to price. Competition based on price pushes towards modular architecture, which minimizes cost to produce at the expense of performance. Product's components become the differentiators, product's manufacturers become component assemblers. When the relevant dimensions of performance are not determined by manufacturers, profits sink to nothing.</p>\n<p>Law of conservation of attractive profits: When modularity and commoditization cause attractive profits to disappear at one stage in the value chain, the opportunity to earn attractive profits with proprietary products will usually emerge at an adjacent stage.<br />\nExample: In personal computer business, the actual assembly of a computer gets commoditized.<br />\nProfits shift upstream to component manufacturers. Some component manufacturers capture profits (Intel). Some get commoditized themselves (RAM producers) and profits shift further upstream to makers of component fabrication equipment (Applied Materials).<br />\nSome profits also shift downstream to firms that integrate across the not-good-enough interface with the customer (Dell's retailing/logistics).</p>\n<p>When you see commoditization coming, think about what piece of value chain you'd like to own.<br />\nGood places to look: customer interface (Dell), components (hard-drive head manufacturers), production machinery (Applied Materials), &quot;recipe&quot;/process for production (Intel)</p>\n",

One of the factors driving consolidation of massive integrated oil companies (IOCs) has been liquidity constraints; access to capital has been a serious driver of M&amp;A.</p>\n<p>Vertical integration (BP buying Amoco to add refining and retailing) has helped eliminate hold-up problems that could not be realistically solved by contractual obligation, even in countries with court systems. In concentrated industries, there is no substitute for owning your channel partner.</p>\n<p>In general, the energy business offers a fascinating set of game-theory-esque case studies. National Oil Companies (NOCs) like Saudi Aramco own refineries in the U.S. basically so that they have enough collateral for American companies to seize (via the U.S. court system) in the event of contractual breach. The insane costs that (for example) Amoco could impose by ceasing to buy oil from BP --- even temporarily --- have impelled consolidation to ensure that upstream firms (exploration and extraction) will have access to the market.</p>\n<p>Empirically, expropriation (when the Venezuelan government nationalizes extraction) doesn't really hurt IOC revenues. NOCs still need technical help with extracting oil, access to the consumers, and often access to capital --- try floating a huge bond issue on the international capital markets if you are Angola.</p>\n<p>And BP/Amoco/ARCO's play to &quot;short the West Coast markets and elevate prices&quot; in 2000 by shipping Alaskan oil to Asia is possibly the coolest nefarious corporate plot in recent history. An American company tried to manipulate oil prices the world's eighth largest economy (California) and almost got away with it!</p>\n",
