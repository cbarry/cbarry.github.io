    <p>My name is Colin Barry. I am interested in building products that solve hard problems and that people enjoy.</p>
<p>I currently work on the storefront product management team at <a href="https://www.wayfair.com">Wayfair</a>. Before that, I built user acquisition and engagement tools for mobile apps at <a href="http://www.localytics.com/">Localytics</a>. Sometimes, I blogged about the <a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/author/colin-barry">stuff my team built</a>. Before that, I worked on clinical integration and healthcare interoperability for <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com">athenahealth</a>.</p>

<p>Mostly a compilation of class notes I took as an MBA student. <a href="http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=bio&amp;facEmId=ssnook">Scott Snook</a> once mentioned that the greatest regret of his MBA experience was not forcing himself to write down &quot;what I learned today&quot; after each day of b-school. So at the beginning of my second year, I started writing down what I learned after every class session. I was fortunate enough to take classes taught by <a href="http://colinbarry.com/?tag=moc">Michael Porter</a>, <a href="http://colinbarry.com/?tag=bsse">Clay Christensen</a>, and <a href="http://colinbarry.com/?tag=ltv">Tom Eisenmann</a> (among many others).</p>
<p>I decided to blog what I learned because there is some <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.20316/abstract">compelling</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_Science_and_Practice#Commitment_and_consistency">research</a> about the power of public commitments to incent people to accomplish their goals. Basically, if you tell all your friends that you will lose 10 pounds or write a novel or start a business, the probability that you will actually do so increases dramatically.</p>
