      <h1>NetFlix (BSSE, Tuesday, Week 8)</h1>

<time datetime="2011-10-19">19 Oct 2011</time><a href="/tags/building-and-sustaining-successful-enterprises/" class="post-tag">building-and-sustaining-successful-enterprises</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>Remember, jobs-to-be-done are universal and timeless. Whatever NetFlix is doing for its customers is a job that George Washington had (so it's not &quot;send them movies.&quot;).<br>
It's probably something like &quot;What can we do tonight (at home)?&quot; or &quot;Help me know what I want to do.&quot;<br>
Our understanding of the job may increase (we may develop ingenious recommendation algorithms) and the experiences associated with the job may evolve, but the core job doesn't change.</p>
<p>Where the profit goes:<br>
Pipes/mail/physical location gets commoditized =&gt; &quot;Help me learn what I want to do!&quot; gets de-commoditized.<br>
If modularity happens in one step in value chain, profits just shift elsewhere...</p>
<p>Henry Ford on why he frequently upgraded the machinery on his production line (apocryphal, via Clay):<br>
&quot;If I don't buy the newest machines all the time, I'll wind up paying the full cost anyway due to lower production volume AND I won't have new machines.&quot;<br>
After some research, I think the real quote --- basically a manager's critique of the base-case fallacy in financial analysis --- might be:<br>
&quot;If a man thinks that his money will earn 5 percent, or 6 percent, he ought to place it where he can get that return, but money placed in a business is not a charge on the business --- or, rather, should not be. It ceases to be money and becomes, or should become, an engine of production, and it is therefore worth what it produces --- and not a fixed sum according to some scale that has no bearing upon the particular business in which the money has been placed.&quot;</p>
