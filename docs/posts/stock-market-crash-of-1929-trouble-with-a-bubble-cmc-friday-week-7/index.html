      <h1>Stock Market Crash of 1929 // Trouble with a Bubble (CMC, Friday, Week 7)</h1>

<p>&quot;Historically, investments made during recessions have delivered some of the best returns.&quot; - some Bessemer Venture Partners report</p>
<p>Ordinary downturns in the business cycle can (relatively easily) turn into a depression. Tradeoff versus &quot;letting things play out&quot; and &quot;regulatory authority&quot; ==&gt; clearly the optimum is somewhere in the middle</p>
<p>Why did Irving Fisher -- the greatest economist of his generation -- miss the Great Depression? Or, why did a bunch of smart people think that the late 1920s run-up was &quot;the new normal?&quot; (Comment: stop me if this seems eerily similar to rhetoric around 2000/2008) - Radical tech changes ====&gt; electricity, communications, internal combustion engine ====&gt; &quot;different from the past&quot; ====&gt; new R&amp;D capabilities inside firms ====&gt; emerging giants: GE, RCA ====&gt; hard to value R&amp;D and firms' intellectual property</p>
<p>- Management practice changes ====&gt; Scientific management ====&gt; New, more efficient organization methods for firms</p>
<p>- Labor utilization/relations ====&gt; virtuous circle: higher standard of living creates more demand creates better firms, etc.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Crash (1) Federal Reserve response =&gt; tighten credit, send contradictory messages (2) Leverage =&gt; one-third of individual investors trading on margin; downturn forces margin calls and mass liquidation (3) Overproduction =&gt; problems forecasting demand; overinvestment in capital goods (4) Gold standard =&gt; interest rates rise, gold flows out of U.S. (5) Low barriers to stock ownership =&gt; fuels bubble in equity prices (6) Inflexible banking sector =&gt; tons of tiny banks; regulations against interstate banking</p>
