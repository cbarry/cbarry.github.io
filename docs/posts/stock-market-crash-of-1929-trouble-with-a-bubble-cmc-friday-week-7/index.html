<p>&quot;Historically, investments made during recessions have delivered some of the best returns.&quot; -- some Bessemer Venture Partners report</p>
<p>Ordinary downturns in the business cycle can (relatively easily) turn into a depression.<br>
Tradeoff versus &quot;letting things play out&quot; and &quot;regulatory authority&quot; ==&gt; clearly the optimum is somewhere in the middle</p>
<p>Why did Irving Fisher --- the greatest economist of his generation --- miss the Great Depression?<br>
Or, why did a bunch of smart people think that the late 1920s run-up was &quot;the new normal?&quot; (Comment: stop me if this seems eerily similar to rhetoric around 2000/2008)<br>
-- Radical tech changes<br>
====&gt; electricity, communications, internal combustion engine<br>
====&gt; &quot;different from the past&quot;<br>
====&gt; new R&amp;D capabilities inside firms<br>
====&gt; emerging giants: GE, RCA<br>
====&gt; hard to value R&amp;D and firms' intellectual property</p>
<p>-- Management practice changes<br>
====&gt; Scientific management<br>
====&gt; New, more efficient organization methods for firms</p>
<p>-- Labor utilization/relations<br>
====&gt; virtuous circle: higher standard of living creates more demand creates better firms, etc.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Crash<br>
(1) Federal Reserve response =&gt; tighten credit, send contradictory messages<br>
(2) Leverage =&gt; one-third of individual investors trading on margin; downturn forces margin calls and mass liquidation<br>
(3) Overproduction =&gt; problems forecasting demand; overinvestment in capital goods<br>
(4) Gold standard =&gt; interest rates rise, gold flows out of U.S.<br>
(5) Low barriers to stock ownership =&gt; fuels bubble in equity prices<br>
(6) Inflexible banking sector =&gt; tons of tiny banks; regulations against interstate banking</p>
