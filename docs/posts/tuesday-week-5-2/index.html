<p>Interesting to think about comparison with Rent the Runway. Both e-commerce, but many differences.</p>
<p>Differences/unique Chegg attributes: - Seasonality =&gt; Chegg makes all its money from 2 three-week periods every year (academic calendar) - Digital future =&gt; Print textbooks are probably not going to be around forever; (slowly) evaporating core business. - Chegg CVP = saving money on textbooks; RTR CVP = &quot;Cinderella moments&quot; - Customers have a finite lifespan (undergrads = four years of books) =&gt; LTV is limited - Customers are REQUIRED to have textbooks (RTR = emotional choice)</p>
<p>Commonality between Chegg and RTR: - Teaching new customer behaviors is challenging. Need to articulate process very clearly... - Homogenous user base = easy chasm - Disruption! (Colin: maybe...)</p>
<p>Capital-intensive startups are hard to manage. End up with a gazillion investors, often many different kinds of investors (angels, VCs, growth equity, etc.) with varied preferences, appetite for risk, etc.</p>
