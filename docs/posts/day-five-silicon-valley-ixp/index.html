<p>Facebook company visit (Sheryl Sandberg [COO], Lori Goler [VP of People and Recruiting]) <a href="http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_0553.jpg"><img src="images/IMG_0553-224x300.jpg" alt="" title="facebooking"></a> Sheryl Sandberg: Many things are better with social. Why do people play Zynga instead of sophisticated games? It's not because of &quot;features&quot; or realism or graphics.</p>
<p>Career advice: &gt;&gt; Get your hands dirty. Get a sales or marketing or operations job. And do real work. &quot;I still do sales calls.&quot; - Sheryl Sandberg</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Look for growing companies. Growth is more important than titles/&quot;level&quot; at every stage of your career. &quot;Get on a rocket ship, and good things will happen.&quot; - Eric Schmidt</p>
<p>On finding mentors: Relationships are based on &quot;real stuff.&quot; Be the best, and you will develop mentors. Don't e-mail them and ask if they will sponsor you.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, what's Big Data?&quot; - Sheryl Sandberg Data alone is useless. Similar reaction to 'credentialing.'</p>
<p>Lori Goler: The answer to basically every case at HBS is &quot;get the right people.&quot; So probably you should think about how to do that.</p>
<p>Came to Facebook because of Zuck's vision: connecting people to the people and things that are important to them. Strong institutional focus on impact. (Reflection: Is this really a value? I'm not sure; I wanted to push back but ran out of time.)</p>
<p>On her initial hesitancy to become HR lead at Facebook: &quot;No man would ever turn down more responsibility!&quot; - Sheryl Sandberg</p>
<p>Reflections on an Entrepreneurial Career in SV (Randy Komisar) Consumer web is a small part of the world, even the venture world. And TechCrunch has become the People Magazine of the IT business. Why is it hyped? Low barriers to entry.</p>
<p>Consequence: consumer web is more like the media business than the innovation business. There were 12 Instagrams when Instagram started; now there's only one. And the critical factor was probably not technology.</p>
<p>Theses for the future: Internet of Things (Nest, other devices that work so well that people bring them into their lives). Big Data and how we use it.</p>
<p>Why big-name venture still chases trends: because their business works best when I read about KPCB in TechCrunch every day.</p>
<p>Overall personal take-away: Build stuff you care about; don't chase fads and gold rushes. Life is too short.</p>
