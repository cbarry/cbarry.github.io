<p>What makes entrepreneurial ventures successful and fun?<br>
-- Alignment =&gt; good new ventures usually have strong alignment between customers, employees, managers, etc.<br>
Why? Because if they don't have strong alignment, they don't make payroll.<br>
Life is fun when everyone is on the same page.<br>
-- Passion =&gt; &quot;because it's your thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Challenge: growth makes alignment more complicated. Is the customer buying from a company or from a person? Early on, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a strategic plan around here: we do sh*t.&quot; -- Old 15.390 TA<br>
This is exactly right for new ventures. It gets less right as ventures start to scale up.</p>
<p>On hiring friends:<br>
&quot;If you have too many friends and you want to get rid of some of them, hiring them is a good way. Because the odds that your best friend should be your #2 are about 300-million-to-1.&quot; -- Howard Anderson<br>
&quot;All those people who were sitting around with you at The Muddy Charles saying 'I'm in, I'm in?' They meant 'part-time in.'&quot; -- Bill Aulet</p>
<p>If you're giving away titles to early employees, the best titles are 'founder' and 'co-founder.' They sounds great, and you won't regret it if you need to hire someone to be their boss when your venture grows.<br>
Be very careful about hiring Chief XYZ Officers.</p>
<p>On pitching your venture:<br>
Don't ever end a pitch with &quot;Thank you for your time.&quot;<br>
There must be an ask, and it must be actionable. Money, advice, a spot on your Board of Advisors, a referral to someone else, a follow-up meeting...<br>
This is not a graded academic exercise. You want something, and if you don't then you shouldn't be giving the pitch.</p>
