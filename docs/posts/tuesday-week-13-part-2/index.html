<p>with <em>Shark Tank</em>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Herjavec">Robert Herjavec</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daymond_John">Daymond John</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban">Mark Cuban</a></p>
<p>We watched excerpts from <em>Shark Tank</em> and discussed/critiqued them. Noam and Deepak Malhotra led the class session.</p>
<p>Robert Herjavec, on being a panelist: &quot;First of all, this is the longest I've ever sat in one place without saying something.&quot;</p>
<p>On the introduction: - Capture the imagination of your audience immediately. (Rob) - Don't give out data at the very start -- peoples' eyes glaze over BUT if you can't touch/see the product, you need data early. (Daymond) - If you have a less tangible or B2B venture, you need a more eloquent/emotional pitch. (Rob) - Captivate, but don't stretch the limits of credibility. It took MSFT 10 years to get to $50M in sales. (Rob)</p>
<p>- Are you pitching a company or a product? Probably you want to start a company. (Noam)</p>
<p>On confidence and lack thereof: - &quot;If you bring up bad news upfront, it's not bad news. It's just a data point.&quot; (Rob) - &quot;Venrock has a set of 25 evaluation criteria for pitches -- 12 of the 25 data points are decided on between when you walk in the front door and when you say the first word.&quot; (Rob)</p>
<p>On Mark Cuban's impromptu 24-second shot clock in the Origaudio episode: - Shockingly similar to traditional VC term sheets -- no-shop clause, exploding offer. (Noam) - Cuban tries to turn an auction into a negotiation. Terrible for the entrepreneurs. Best response: find a way to keep Cuban in the auction. &quot;Mark, I am flattered by your offer etc. but I think you wouldn't actually want me to take a deal like this if I was running a business with your money.&quot;</p>
<p>Why Daymond offer to buy entrepreneurs out for $300K: - Thought they'd be bad partners/managers. - Intended to take licenses and distribution agreement and run business himself...because he'd probably end up doing that anyway. Takeaway: Think about how some offers reveal the motivations of prospective investors. (Noam)</p>
<p>The best entrepreneurs on <em>Shark Tank</em>, according to Mark Cuban: - Know product, company, and industry cold. - The real test is Q&amp;A, not the pitch. It reveals whether you were willing to do the prep work.</p>
<p>The best entrepreneurs on <em>Shark Tank</em>, according to Daymond: - 100% commitment, long-term strategy, scalability.</p>
<p>The best entrepreneurs on <em>Shark Tank</em>, according to Rob: (1) Captivate me (because I have a short attention span). (2) Humble arrogance. (3) Know their numbers.</p>
<p>Generally, good presenters take control of questions. Polite; usually humorous.</p>
<p>Al (one of the entrepreneurs in the next season): How did you prepare? Five hours a day in the mirror (really?). But also, it's my life. Of course I can answer questions about it.</p>
