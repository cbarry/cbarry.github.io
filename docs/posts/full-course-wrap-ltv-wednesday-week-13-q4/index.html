<p>My very last class at HBS. Honored to have as incredible instructors as Tom Eisenmann and Jeff Bussgang...</p>
<p>Takeaways from listening to two really smart FIELD teams present: - Balsamiq is a pretty excellent tool for wireframing. - Good technique: do some customer interviews, make wireframes of five possible features. Then ask people to allocate 100 &quot;points&quot; among the five features. Figure out what people really want (because they want everything, but they probably don't want everything equally).</p>
<p>An easy interface that integrates several different types/sources of data in a fairly superficial way is often a very valuable thing. - Jeff Bussgang</p>
<p>- One channel to consider/CAC to measure: in-person sales. Send a guy with an iPad to the customer; show the customer a mockup; ask for an e-mail address.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very inexpensive to build a brand as a first-mover. It's very expensive to build a brand as a second-mover.&quot; - Jeff Bussgang</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/11-108.pdf">With a Little Help from my (Random) Friends: Success and Failure in Post-Business School Entrepreneurship</a>, Lerner and Malmendier (2007): Only 13 percent of HBS startups ('97-'04) succeed by any measure. And the number of real &quot;successes&quot; is a lot lower. But most founders end up in interesting places regardless.</p>
<p>&quot;Entrepreneurship is a career path. What you're doing right now is what you'll be doing in 10 years.&quot; - HBS Alum, Class of 1999</p>
