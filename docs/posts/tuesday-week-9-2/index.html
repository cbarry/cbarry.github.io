      <h1>HP and the Kittyhawk (BSSE, Tuesday, Week 9)</h1>

<time datetime="2011-11-02">02 Nov 2011</time><a href="/tags/building-and-sustaining-successful-enterprises/" class="post-tag">building-and-sustaining-successful-enterprises</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>BSSE in a microcosm =&gt; Every single HP employee working on Kittyhawk project signed a pledge: &quot;I am going to build a small, dumb, cheap disk drive!&quot;<br>
The project has management buy-in; managed as separate BU; adequate funding; no pressure to fit in to existing profit model; builds product based on customer feedback; delivers on time!; etc. EVERYTHING IS RIGHT!<br>
Kittyhawk still produces an expensive disk drive, not a cheap one. The project is a miserable failure.</p>
<p>Today's class: disruption in HR. I am skeptical...<br>
Summary: causal mechanism for management success is exposure to previous, &quot;similar&quot; situations (whatever that means).<br>
Thus, select for past experiences &amp; capacity to learn, not &quot;adjectives&quot; (past results).<br>
Is this a meaningful/actionable distinction? I don't think so; reeks of distinctions that can be made in hindsight but cannot be easily discerned ex ante.</p>
