<p>Victor Frankl (author of &quot;Man's Search for Meaning&quot;): &quot;78% of American youngsters are most concerned with finding meaning and purpose in life.&quot; Upshot: most people are not materialistic and grabby, despite appearances. &quot;Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should be, and he will become as he can and should be.&quot; - Goethe</p>
<p>Why think about a leadership purpose: makes the journey of life meaningful. Practical answer =&gt; Without a purpose, why would anyone follow you? Without a purpose that is larger than you, you're just at the mercy of your ego.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.&quot; - George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p>Example purposes: &quot;Eliminate chaos!&quot; &quot;Bring water and power to the two billion people who don't have it.&quot; &quot;Lead soldiers!&quot;</p>
