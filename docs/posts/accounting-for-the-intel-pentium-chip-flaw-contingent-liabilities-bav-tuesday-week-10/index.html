      <h1>Accounting for the Intel Pentium Chip Flaw / Contingent Liabilities (BAV, Tuesday, Week 10)</h1>

<p>Accounting standards for when/how to recognize uncertain liabilities are highly subjective (unlike rules for, say, when to use a capital vs. operating lease).<br>
Key factors: liability is probable, size of liability can be reasonably estimated.<br>
Also, &quot;The Contingent Liabilities&quot; would be a great name for a band.</p>
<p>Big picture differences between measuring contingent liabilities under US GAAP and IFRS:<br>
GAAP = &quot;best estimate&quot; of a liability --- so the outcome with the highest probability<br>
IFRS = probability-weighted average (think about it as if you could securitize the liability), discount to a present value. Each period, recognize interest expense on value of principle and accrued interest.</p>
<p>In the case of Intel, real challenges because the nature of the flaw is known but management policy will determine the size of the liability.<br>
Key uncertainty: Return rate on flawed Pentiums is unknown. But we can probably estimate it...</p>
<p>Impact on valuation:<br>
Managers usually want to be conservative (err on the side of larger liability). Why?<br>
Take a big hit early, only reach into the &quot;cookie jar&quot; once. Label the hit to earnings as &quot;one-time restructuring&quot; and avoid future guesses/downward expectations.</p>
