<p>Sierra Ventures &quot;State of the Space&quot; on Venture Investment<br>
VC is an industry of collusion as much as cooperation (why vast majority of reputable firms are on Sand Hill Road)</p>
<p>Interesting concept: Sierra's &quot;CIO Advisory Group&quot; =&gt; informal relationship with CIOs of 75 large tech firms<br>
-- Makes it easy for portfolio companies to get feedback from potential enterprise customers<br>
-- Enables Sierra to get information on market dynamics to drive investment decisions (Will big IT departments buy the latest, greatest SaaS CRM app?)</p>
<p>Flow of LP money into VC has tailed off in the last 24 months. Not all is well.<br>
Why? Frothy environment? Mediocre returns across VC asset class as a whole? Low barriers to entry for software startups driving VC disintermediation (angels and growth equity are still huge)?</p>
<p>Eric Ries on the Lean Startup<br>
&quot;I'm a big failure. If you follow me, you too can be a big failure.&quot; -- E.R.<br>
(Caveat: clearly I am a fairly serious believer in the value of hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship, or I wouldn't have pre-ordered/read the book and most of Ries' blog posts.)</p>
<p>On the lack of customer development:<br>
&quot;Most entrepreneurs are waiting for Zool.&quot;<br>

<p>Basic premise is that development of IT has changed the nature of tech entrepreneurship. Almost everything can be built. You CAN build a social network for dogs. Our problems have shifted from:<br>
We don't have enough stuff (productive capacity).<br>
TO<br>
How do we make the right stuff (allocation)?</p>
<p>Ries on all successful companies:<br>
&quot;Founders look like idiots at the beginning.&quot;<br>
Publicists and ghostwriters and marketing departments for successful companies make it seem like the founders were visionary at the beginning. Usually not true.<br>
Examples:<br>
Digital cash for PDAs =&gt; Online payments for eBay (PayPal)<br>
A better BASIC interpreter =&gt; the most enduring operating system monopoly on the planet (Microsoft)</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever you think [about your new venture], you're probably wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>IDEO group activities/tour<br>
Critical factors: (1) empathy for your users and (2) humility to learn from your users.</p>
<p>How to learn from your users: Listen to specific stories; don't ask general questions.<br>
Example: &quot;How did you get home for Christmas last month?&quot; NOT &quot;How do you usually get home for the holidays?&quot;</p>
<p>Good products are: Feasible (technology), Viable (business), Desirable (human factors/design)</p>
<p>Michael Dearing, Harrison Metal (incubator)<br>
Incubators = between retail-level angel investors and traditional VC funds. Sweet spot is the time between technical insight and actual paying customers.</p>
<p>Basic investment model: $500K-$1M investment, exit in 5-10 years</p>
