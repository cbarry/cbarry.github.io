<p>Sierra Ventures &quot;State of the Space&quot; on Venture Investment VC is an industry of collusion as much as cooperation (why vast majority of reputable firms are on Sand Hill Road)</p>
<p>Interesting concept: Sierra's &quot;CIO Advisory Group&quot; =&gt; informal relationship with CIOs of 75 large tech firms - Makes it easy for portfolio companies to get feedback from potential enterprise customers - Enables Sierra to get information on market dynamics to drive investment decisions (Will big IT departments buy the latest, greatest SaaS CRM app?)</p>
<p>Flow of LP money into VC has tailed off in the last 24 months. Not all is well. Why? Frothy environment? Mediocre returns across VC asset class as a whole? Low barriers to entry for software startups driving VC disintermediation (angels and growth equity are still huge)?</p>
<p>Eric Ries on the Lean Startup &quot;I'm a big failure. If you follow me, you too can be a big failure.&quot; - E.R. (Caveat: clearly I am a fairly serious believer in the value of hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship, or I wouldn't have pre-ordered/read the book and most of Ries' blog posts.)</p>
<p>On the lack of customer development: &quot;Most entrepreneurs are waiting for Zool.&quot; <img src="images/zool.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Basic premise is that development of IT has changed the nature of tech entrepreneurship. Almost everything can be built. You CAN build a social network for dogs. Our problems have shifted from: We don't have enough stuff (productive capacity). TO How do we make the right stuff (allocation)?</p>
<p>Ries on all successful companies: &quot;Founders look like idiots at the beginning.&quot; Publicists and ghostwriters and marketing departments for successful companies make it seem like the founders were visionary at the beginning. Usually not true. Examples: Digital cash for PDAs =&gt; Online payments for eBay (PayPal) A better BASIC interpreter =&gt; the most enduring operating system monopoly on the planet (Microsoft)</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever you think [about your new venture], you're probably wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>IDEO group activities/tour Critical factors: (1) empathy for your users and (2) humility to learn from your users.</p>
<p>How to learn from your users: Listen to specific stories; don't ask general questions. Example: &quot;How did you get home for Christmas last month?&quot; NOT &quot;How do you usually get home for the holidays?&quot;</p>
<p>Good products are: Feasible (technology), Viable (business), Desirable (human factors/design)</p>
<p>Michael Dearing, Harrison Metal (incubator) Incubators = between retail-level angel investors and traditional VC funds. Sweet spot is the time between technical insight and actual paying customers.</p>
<p>Basic investment model: $500K-$1M investment, exit in 5-10 years</p>
<p>Resource: <a href="http://www.seriesseed.com/">Series Seed Equity Documents</a> =&gt; easy template for early-stage equity financing</p>
<p>Book to read: Gordon MacKenzie's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Orbiting-Giant-Hairball-Corporate-Surviving/dp/0670879835">&quot;Orbiting the Giant Hairball&quot;</a></p>
