      <h1>Theory of the CEO (BSSE, Monday, Week 13)</h1>

<p>Interesting commentary on the capabilities and limitations of the class... If you're trying to build an airplane, which is more important to understand: gravity or Bernoulli's Principle? &quot;BSSE is a course about gravity.&quot; - Clay Christensen Our class section seemed to think gravity is more important, which makes no sense to me. I can design a (bad, probably doomed) plane with a decent understanding of Bernoulli's Principle and some intuitive knowledge about the world (don't make the plane too heavy). Gravity gives me almost no insight into how to make a plane fly; it only describes for me how poorly-made planes fall.</p>
<p>Several theories what CEOs do: (1) CEO is in a reacting role, driven by expectations of investors and analysts =&gt; &quot;Forces act on me; what's important is that I stay in balance and do what the Street wants.&quot; (2) CEO puts together a cohort of players/a winning team; CEO as teacher =&gt; &quot;Does everyone involved understand how we make money so they will all perform their roles? I want no surprises.&quot; (3) CEO is a communicator of his vision/balancer vis-a-vis shareholders =&gt; &quot;Be trusted, so that my company can make good long-term decisions.&quot;</p>
<p>I am intuitively drawn to (2) and (3), mostly because I think leaders actually should have insight into the best strategic/tactical path for their firms. The &quot;leader as caretaker&quot; in (1) seems implausible.</p>
