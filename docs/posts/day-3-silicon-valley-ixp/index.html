<p>Mentor meeting (Scott Hartsmann [Trion Worlds] and Fred Wang [Trinity Ventures]) How to use lean customer development in a MMO startup (time to market: five years) - Expose the storyline to customers early - Expose PMs and developers to customers via Twitter, Facebook, etc.</p>
<p>It's not that hard to get a non-technical job at some Silicon Valley startup. People are reluctant to move to San Francisco, hat in hand, and try to get a job. But actually being there &quot;focuses the mind.&quot; Maybe not the best idea right away, but easier than you'd imagine (ex ante).</p>
<p>Don't ever burn bridges/scorch earth leaving an employer. The world is too small, especially given how easy it is to do background checks via LinkedIn (find indirect links to prospective employees; perform informal due diligence).</p>
<p>Lunch at Kleiner Perkins (Aileen Lee) Don't talk about the exit in a pitch. Your (prospective) investors can figure it out, and they will if they're interested.</p>
<p>Easiest way to raise money: have a working prototype and some customers/prospective customers.</p>
<p>Indirect observation/trend: Ask how people use a product/service, not what they think about it. Basically all of the smart people I encountered so far ask &quot;Do you use Pinterest? How do you use it?&quot; and not &quot;Do you like Pinterest?&quot;</p>
<p>Stanford d.school reception/Stanford Technology Ventures Program <a href="http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_0541.jpg"><img src="images/IMG_0541-224x300.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0541"></a> Heidi Roizen exists. She is very nice and incredibly savvy. Also, I would never want to be an HBS case protagonist (aka MBA celebrity) -- it's a little weird to have 950 people judge you based on a 10-page excerpt of your life.</p>
<p>Enduring relationships are based on 'real things' and being useful to others, not glad-handing at parties.</p>
