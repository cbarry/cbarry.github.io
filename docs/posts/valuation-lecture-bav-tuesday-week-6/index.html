<p>&quot;I hope you had enough coffee -- this is going to be awesome.&quot; - F. Brochet, before launching into lengthy discussion of valuation</p>
<p>Traditional valuation methodologies:</p>
<p>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</p>
<p>Measures available cash flow to equity (dividends or repurchase): (Net Income) - (Changes in Book Value of Net Op Assets) - (Changes in Book Value of Net Debt) Projects future performance (How far? Depends on maturity of firm...) Terminal Value =&gt; often 70 or 80% of firm's value Discount rate =&gt; sensitive to assumptions, basic CAPM should work but hard to find comps and several empirical challenges (size, book/market, momentum)</p>
<p>Multiples</p>
<p>Simple; usually a good starting point Need good judgment in selecting peer; usually hard to figure out &quot;real&quot; peers Sensitive to non-recurring items, temporary performance blips, etc. M&amp;A premium -- how do we think about it?</p>
<p>An alternate methodology:</p>
<p>earnings-based models</p>
<p>- Depends on semi-strong market efficiency (price reflects all publicly available data) - Rejects &quot;greater fool theory&quot; and industry-practice (everyone uses 12x EBITDA, so doing anything else actually imposes risk) - Fundamental problem with dividend discounting valuation methodologies -- namely, most public companies don't actually pay dividends! - Problem with DCF: capturing all flows is tricky, usually ends up being a more complicated version of multiples because terminal value is huge and hard to estimate</p>
<p>So, assume that &quot;abnormal earnings&quot; (above equity cost of capital) will eventually revert to the mean.</p>
<p>Still problems with abnormal earnings valuation: accounting data may need adjustment, off-balance sheet items not obvious, assumes &quot;clean surplus&quot; (where all changes in equity value flow through the income statement)</p>
