<p>New strategies require new organizational structure.</p>
<p>Stages of American industry development (until mid-20th century):<br>
(1) Product/technology innovation (railroads, discovery of oil, etc.)<br>
THEN<br>
(2) Feeding frenzy/land grab (tons of small players)<br>
THEN<br>
(3) Ineffectual attempts to collude (cartels) =&gt; extract rents<br>
THEN<br>
(4) Consolidation: Horizontal integration =&gt; typically requires capital, professional management, innovation in organizational structure (centralized decision-making, accounting/control)<br>
THEN<br>
(5) Consolidation: Vertical integration =&gt; requires more innovation in organizational structure<br>
THEN<br>
(6) Regulatory/populist backlash</p>
<p>The monopolists' double-bind: so you think you want a monopoly...<br>
Firms want to consolidate to gain scale economies, control prices, etc.<br>
BUT<br>
Lean, differentiated firms deter competitors; attractive industries invite new entrants.</p>
<p>Du Pont: the first multi-division firm --- dragged into it kicking and screaming by middle managers...<br>
-- From one product-line (gunpowder) to many product-lines with manufacturing core competency.<br>
-- Hard to measure performance? Devise the DuPont Formula...</p>
<p>Du Pont's initial attempt to expand into multiple product-lines: should yield tons of economies of scale --- actually yields remarkable diseconomies of scale and zero customer focus.<br>
Solution: multiple divisions (each division with its own marketing, sales, purchasing, etc.).<br>
Counterintuitive because the firm gains efficiency by adding redundant departments and increasing &quot;bureaucracy.&quot;<br>
And you need a ton of general managers (utility players, not specialists)...</p>
