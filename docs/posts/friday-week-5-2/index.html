<p>New strategies require new organizational structure.</p>
<p>Stages of American industry development (until mid-20th century): (1) Product/technology innovation (railroads, discovery of oil, etc.) THEN (2) Feeding frenzy/land grab (tons of small players) THEN (3) Ineffectual attempts to collude (cartels) =&gt; extract rents THEN (4) Consolidation: Horizontal integration =&gt; typically requires capital, professional management, innovation in organizational structure (centralized decision-making, accounting/control) THEN (5) Consolidation: Vertical integration =&gt; requires more innovation in organizational structure THEN (6) Regulatory/populist backlash</p>
<p>The monopolists' double-bind: so you think you want a monopoly... Firms want to consolidate to gain scale economies, control prices, etc. BUT Lean, differentiated firms deter competitors; attractive industries invite new entrants.</p>
<p>Du Pont: the first multi-division firm -- dragged into it kicking and screaming by middle managers... - From one product-line (gunpowder) to many product-lines with manufacturing core competency. - Hard to measure performance? Devise the DuPont Formula...</p>
<p>Du Pont's initial attempt to expand into multiple product-lines: should yield tons of economies of scale -- actually yields remarkable diseconomies of scale and zero customer focus. Solution: multiple divisions (each division with its own marketing, sales, purchasing, etc.). Counterintuitive because the firm gains efficiency by adding redundant departments and increasing &quot;bureaucracy.&quot; And you need a ton of general managers (utility players, not specialists)...</p>
