<p>Venture Debt =&gt; Interest (more than bank loans) + Warrants (less than VC) + Option for investment in future rounds (like VC) Typically 3.5 year loans with 1% interest due per month. Borrower starts principal payments after 6 mo.</p>
<p>Purpose: another 4-6 mo of &quot;runway&quot; for venture. Not much dilution; enough cash to get to the next milestone/round of funding.</p>
<p>Good venture debt providers are not super-worried about repayment. Don't think about it like a 30-year mortgage on a house; it's a loan to get venture to the next round of financing. As long as firm lands a B Round, the venture debt provider gets repaid. And good VCs in the A Round almost always means that there will be a B Round.</p>
<p>Relatedly: Series B is probably riskier for venture debt provider than Series A. Less certainty that there will be a Series C...</p>
<p>On borrower default: &quot;Debt guys can make life physical for a small company.&quot; - Patrick Lee, Pinnacle Ventures</p>
