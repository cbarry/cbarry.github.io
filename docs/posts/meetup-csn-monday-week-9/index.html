      <h1>Meetup (CSN, Monday, Week 9)</h1>

<p>Next step for Meetup in 2009: better engage existing users or attract more users?</p>
<p>Get more users. Why? Because double output of funnel by increasing sign-up rate from 5 to 10% than by increasing show up rate from 50% to 100%... Conversion funnel: <a href="http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/funnel3.jpg"><img src="images/funnel3-1024x572.jpg" alt="" title="funnel"></a></p>
<p>Ways to get traffic/users: (1) Traditional Advertising (2) Virality/WoM -- Friend-to-friend (F2F): very low for meet sites; usually stigma/inherent problems (if you had 10 friends to do activity X, you wouldn't need a meet platform) -- Stranger-to-stranger (S2S): potentially effective; prospective new user sees something about meet site on Twitter, a blog, etc. (3) Product-driven traffic: usually least effective</p>
<p>&quot;How big a problem is this in the industry: 'I will build a killer product and peeps will come.'&quot; - M.P.</p>
<p>Evaluating Meetup: Breadth =&gt; not good Search =&gt; works quite well: profiles, opportunities to display interesting, waiting list feature Interaction =&gt; not great: organizer (not Meetup) controls user experience, requires tons of time/commitment to be a good organizer</p>
<p>Doug Atkins (former Chief Community Officer):</p>
<p>- UX is not really under Meetup's control - Meetup core use case: find &quot;like others&quot; for people with new need, NOT social failures/flawed people ===&gt; Users tend to have changed geographies or life circumstances (new mother)</p>
<p>Basic for engaging people in a new activity: make a series of increasingly-demanding asks Example: political campaign Step 1) Sign up on our website Step 2) &quot;Like&quot; on Facebook Step 3) Give $5 Step 4) Come to a march Step 5) Lead a march</p>
<p>If you go straight from Step 1 to Step 5, it doesn't work and you scare people away. Meetup needs to do a better job of facilitating low-investment interaction -- right now, asking you to come to a party where you don't know anyone. And that's scary...</p>
