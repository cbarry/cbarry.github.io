      <h1>Indonesia / Attracting Foreign Investment (MOC, Tuesday, Week 8)</h1>

<p>Not all FDI is created equal. Firms seeking low wages are probably not going to make the sorts of investments that will result in dramatic productivity gains.</p>
<p>What does FDI do for a country? - Access to additional capital (from outside country) -&gt; helps Balance of Payments - Improve business environment (maybe) - Create businesses, jobs, wealth, exports (depends on context) - Technology transfer</p>
<p>What's attractive about Indonesia (in general)? - Buy assets on the cheap, low wages - Huge population -- 235M people = big domestic market - Natural resources: gas, coal, oil - Bali!</p>
<p>So why no FDI under Suharto/Sukarno? - Corruption, lack of transparency - Dislike of foreigners (legacy of Dutch rule) =&gt; Protection of local firms - Volatile - Lots of ethnicities, lots of islands, lots of languages =&gt; hard to build national unity</p>
<p>&quot;Suharto was a real capitalist...he owned 471 companies...17% of the market cap!&quot; - Hiro Takeuchi</p>
<p>Why no FDI under Reformasi? - Decentralization -- making an investment is complex/takes forever to approve - Still missing infrastructure - Terrorism (Bali bombings in '02, '03, and '05) Bottom line: lingering macro and microeconomic problems.</p>
<p>Takeaways: Foreign direct investment is NOT the whole answer to national economic development. FDI policy cannot be isolated from larger national strategic decision-making.</p>
