<p>&quot;When am I ready to found a company?&quot; is an incredibly hard question to answer. Argument for waiting: Gaining experience increases domain expertise, leadership skills, credibility, and self-confidence (maybe). Argument for founding ASAP: But I can learn all these things on the job! I learn quickly, and I know a lot about myself! Counterargument: Everyone thinks they learn quickly and know a lot about themselves. People are notoriously bad judges of themselves.</p>
<p>Barry Nalls' contention: Don't ever start a company without sales experience. Don't start a company straight out of business school.</p>
<p>Also, you know you're going to take a hit when the case protagonist -- who has been sitting in on the class discussion -- opens his personal monologue with, &quot;Where's Colin?&quot; I still think there are inherent challenges for new enterprises with hyper-sales-oriented founders. A summer at athena taught me that you need to pick your client commitments wisely.</p>
