      <h1>The Labor Movement Between the Wars / UAW vs. General Motors (CMC, Thursday, Week 8)</h1>

<p>A testament to the current state of labor relations in America: the NYC public schoolday ends at 2:57 and 30 seconds. Compromise is a strange beast.</p>
<p>Trends in labor in the 1920s:<br>
-- Welfare capitalism (cooperative company unions)<br>
===&gt; &quot;share the wealth&quot; ... but not sharing much of the power, claims of injustice</p>
<p>-- AF of L<br>
===&gt; militant to &quot;necessary auxiliary&quot; to schism/CIO</p>
<p>-- CIO (and expansion across multiple industries)<br>
===&gt;Â <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L._Lewis">John L. Lewis</a>: fosters disconnect between workers and managers OR creates value?<br>
===&gt; pivotal role in building the system</p>
<p>-- Role of government<br>
===&gt; regulatory powers, generally sympathetic to unions (Wagner Act: firms must accept collective bargaining)</p>
<p>Increasing separation between managers and works<br>
===&gt; ethnic tensions<br>
===&gt; shift from workers as skilled craftsman to workers as interchangeable cogs</p>
<p>UAW vs. GM<br>
UAW: Big demand = sole bargaining. Also: more union rights, seniority protection, no unjust dismissals, decrease working hours, minimum pay.<br>
GM: No to everything; labor should stay out of management prerogatives.</p>
<p>Aftermath of the strike in Flint, Mich. (1937)<br>
=&gt; Apex of U.S. auto industry = 1955 (almost two decades later)<br>
=&gt; Still riding high in 1975<br>
=&gt; Japanese competitors pull ahead in 1985 and never really look back.<br>
And we still have a massive auto industry to bail out in 2008.</p>
<p>Sloan might blame the unions: capital should've been allocated away from dying industries long before. No easy answers...</p>
