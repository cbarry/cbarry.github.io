      <h1>The Labor Movement Between the Wars / UAW vs. General Motors (CMC, Thursday, Week 8)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-03-23">23 Mar 2012</time><a href="/tags/cmc/" class="post-tag">cmc</a>

<p>A testament to the current state of labor relations in America: the NYC public schoolday ends at 2:57 and 30 seconds. Compromise is a strange beast.</p>
<p>Trends in labor in the 1920s: - Welfare capitalism (cooperative company unions) ===&gt; &quot;share the wealth&quot; ... but not sharing much of the power, claims of injustice</p>
<p>- AF of L ===&gt; militant to &quot;necessary auxiliary&quot; to schism/CIO</p>
<p>- CIO (and expansion across multiple industries) ===&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L._Lewis">John L. Lewis</a>: fosters disconnect between workers and managers OR creates value? ===&gt; pivotal role in building the system</p>
<p>- Role of government ===&gt; regulatory powers, generally sympathetic to unions (Wagner Act: firms must accept collective bargaining)</p>
<p>Increasing separation between managers and works ===&gt; ethnic tensions ===&gt; shift from workers as skilled craftsman to workers as interchangeable cogs</p>
<p>UAW vs. GM UAW: Big demand = sole bargaining. Also: more union rights, seniority protection, no unjust dismissals, decrease working hours, minimum pay. GM: No to everything; labor should stay out of management prerogatives.</p>
<p>Aftermath of the strike in Flint, Mich. (1937) =&gt; Apex of U.S. auto industry = 1955 (almost two decades later) =&gt; Still riding high in 1975 =&gt; Japanese competitors pull ahead in 1985 and never really look back. And we still have a massive auto industry to bail out in 2008.</p>
<p>Sloan might blame the unions: capital should've been allocated away from dying industries long before. No easy answers...</p>
