      <h1>Maiden in America (CMC, Thursday, Week 7)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-03-08">08 Mar 2012</time><a href="/tags/cmc/" class="post-tag">cmc</a>

<p>Maidenform and the development/commercialization of the bra: A positive example of what emerged from rapid urbanization and social/economic transformation in American cities. Compare to Al Capone... Also, one of the first examples of highly successful female entrepreneurship in America.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_Rosenthal">Ida Rosenthal</a>: Jewish immigrant from Minsk, lands in NYC Lucky? And incredibly savvy. Builds company with $4K of invested capital. Takes charge of finances and marketing; husband does product design And still pays herself less than her husband and makes William Rosenthal the company's President (Commentary: &quot;Please let him earn more money than I do -- you might not understand that now but believe me, you will one day. Otherwise, that's a recipe for disaster.&quot; - Alex Goran, 'Up in the Air,' on finding the right husband. Enduring stereotypes...)</p>
<p>Also, a product of NYC: Garment district/fashion cluster Changing role of women; business in the home = possible Geographic density, cheap labor</p>
<p>Still, constant tension between pioneering role of women/challenging stereotypes VS. selling product in a male-dominated world: Sales force is all-male William takes charge of company on paper Even at the start, advertising tone is aspirational/wishy-washy (I think) =&gt; &quot;I dreamed...&quot; vs. &quot;I am...&quot; Corporate culture: pin-up of the month =&gt; selling sex/desire from men from the start (I think)</p>
<p>Succession in family businesses is tough: Maidenform bankruptcy/restructuring in the late 90s/00s.</p>
