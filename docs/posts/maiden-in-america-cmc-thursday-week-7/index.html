      <h1>Maiden in America (CMC, Thursday, Week 7)</h1>

<p>Maidenform and the development/commercialization of the bra:<br>
A positive example of what emerged from rapid urbanization and social/economic transformation in American cities. Compare to Al Capone...<br>
Also, one of the first examples of highly successful female entrepreneurship in America.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_Rosenthal">Ida Rosenthal</a>: Jewish immigrant from Minsk, lands in NYC<br>
Lucky? And incredibly savvy. Builds company with $4K of invested capital.<br>
Takes charge of finances and marketing; husband does product design<br>
And still pays herself less than her husband and makes William Rosenthal the company's President<br>
(Commentary: &quot;Please let him earn more money than I do --- you might not understand that now but believe me, you will one day. Otherwise, that's a recipe for disaster.&quot; -- Alex Goran, 'Up in the Air,' on finding the right husband. Enduring stereotypes...)</p>
<p>Also, a product of NYC:<br>
Garment district/fashion cluster<br>
Changing role of women; business in the home = possible<br>
Geographic density, cheap labor</p>
<p>Still, constant tension between pioneering role of women/challenging stereotypes VS. selling product in a male-dominated world:<br>
Sales force is all-male<br>
William takes charge of company on paper<br>
Even at the start, advertising tone is aspirational/wishy-washy (I think) =&gt; &quot;I dreamed...&quot; vs. &quot;I am...&quot;<br>
Corporate culture: pin-up of the month =&gt; selling sex/desire from men from the start (I think)</p>
<p>Succession in family businesses is tough: Maidenform bankruptcy/restructuring in the late 90s/00s.</p>
