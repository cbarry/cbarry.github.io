<p>mixi: Our first case on a &quot;friend&quot; platform. A wildly successful Japanese blogging platform.</p>
<p>Network: - Much smaller than Facebook: avg = 27 friends =&gt; only add &quot;strong friends;&quot; exclude boss and ex - Fictitious names, fake photos - Still friends with strangers...</p>
<p>Write: - Lengthy diary entries: one paragraph or more, lots of comments - Expectation of privacy: see &quot;footprints&quot; - High impact/meaning to friends</p>
<p>Read: - Leaves footprints (imagine if you could see who viewed your Facebook profile): prevents stalking - Strangers can read...</p>
<p>Still &quot;meet&quot; elements even though it's a &quot;friend&quot; product...</p>
<p>Who uses this? Narrow set of users, small proportion of Japanese population (18-27) =&gt; LOW virality Typical of friend platforms: you don't invite everyone you know.</p>
<p>What is the appeal in Japan? More normative bounds on behavior = more social failures Hard to meet people, in-person friend interactions highly structured</p>
<p>On monetization: Monetization is much easier on &quot;meet&quot; platforms than &quot;friend&quot; platforms. You can just charge -- it's really hard to meet new people. Friend platforms must monetize indirectly: large user bases, depend on virality and/or high engagement.</p>
<p>On engagement (data from a several &quot;friend&quot; platforms): - Fully 70% of activity is stalking (reading about others). - Read is always controllable! Add footprints (or something like it). - Why is Facebook really appealing? Because it is really hard to be nosy in real life. But easy on FB!</p>
