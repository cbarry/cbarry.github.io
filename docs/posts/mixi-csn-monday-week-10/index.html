<p>mixi: Our first case on a &quot;friend&quot; platform. A wildly successful Japanese blogging platform.</p>
<p>Network:<br>
-- Much smaller than Facebook: avg = 27 friends =&gt; only add &quot;strong friends;&quot; exclude boss and ex<br>
-- Fictitious names, fake photos<br>
-- Still friends with strangers...</p>
<p>Write:<br>
-- Lengthy diary entries: one paragraph or more, lots of comments<br>
-- Expectation of privacy: see &quot;footprints&quot;<br>
-- High impact/meaning to friends</p>
<p>Read:<br>
-- Leaves footprints (imagine if you could see who viewed your Facebook profile): prevents stalking<br>
-- Strangers can read...</p>
<p>Still &quot;meet&quot; elements even though it's a &quot;friend&quot; product...</p>
<p>Who uses this?<br>
Narrow set of users, small proportion of Japanese population (18-27) =&gt; LOW virality<br>
Typical of friend platforms: you don't invite everyone you know.</p>
<p>What is the appeal in Japan?<br>
More normative bounds on behavior = more social failures<br>
Hard to meet people, in-person friend interactions highly structured</p>
<p>On monetization:<br>
Monetization is much easier on &quot;meet&quot; platforms than &quot;friend&quot; platforms. You can just charge --- it's really hard to meet new people.<br>
Friend platforms must monetize indirectly: large user bases, depend on virality and/or high engagement.</p>
<p>On engagement (data from a several &quot;friend&quot; platforms):<br>
-- Fully 70% of activity is stalking (reading about others).<br>
-- Read is always controllable! Add footprints (or something like it).<br>
-- Why is Facebook really appealing? Because it is really hard to be nosy in real life. But easy on FB!</p>
