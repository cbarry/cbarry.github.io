<p>What was &quot;scientific management?&quot; A complete mental revolution... Timing/work study + incentives to perform =&gt; spread across organization &quot;first class&quot; vs. &quot;second class&quot; employees =&gt; lazy Increasing the size of the pie, independent of how it gets divided (maybe...)</p>
<p>Taylor's goal: get rid of the foreman <a href="http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/scimgmt.jpg"><img src="images/scimgmt.jpg" alt="" title="scimgmt"></a></p>
<p>But lots of problems: - Foreman = advocate for workers, guardian of culture. Source of innovation (middle management produced M-Form in DuPont). Integrate new employees. - Who do workmen aspire to be? What does career progression look like? - Foreman = gatekeeper of information, source of quality control (when quality is not incredibly obvious) - Who supervises? Who settles disputes? - What replaces the foreman? Usually, unions.</p>
<p>Fairness problems. Scientific management purports to increase the size of the pie without concern for how it gets divided. Early descriptions: labor keeps half of surplus. But Schmidt example from Taylor's congressional testimony: output increases by 3.6x, wage to labor increases by 1.6x =&gt; gains tend to go to capital More broadly, we tend to specialize the &quot;Planning Department&quot; in things like management consulting practices -- outsiders and senior management capture tons of rent from any improvement in productivity...</p>
<p>So how does this end? <a href="http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/tayloroutcomes.jpg"><img src="images/tayloroutcomes-1024x772.jpg" alt="" title="tayloroutcomes"></a> Game theory: Can we get to top-left quartile? - Empirically, tendency for management to extract as much surplus as possible (push towards top-right quartile). Management is usually concentrated; labor tends to be fragmented... - Backlash from labor: organize/unionize and push towards bottom-left quartile.</p>
