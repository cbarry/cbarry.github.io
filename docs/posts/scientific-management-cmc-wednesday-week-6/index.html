<p>What was &quot;scientific management?&quot;<br>
A complete mental revolution...<br>
Timing/work study + incentives to perform =&gt; spread across organization<br>
&quot;first class&quot; vs. &quot;second class&quot; employees =&gt; lazy<br>
Increasing the size of the pie, independent of how it gets divided (maybe...)</p>
<p>Taylor's goal: get rid of the foreman<br>
<a href="../../img/scimgmt.jpg"><img src="../../img/scimgmt.jpg" alt="" title="scimgmt"></a></p>
<p>But lots of problems:<br>
-- Foreman = advocate for workers, guardian of culture. Source of innovation (middle management produced M-Form in DuPont). Integrate new employees.<br>
-- Who do workmen aspire to be? What does career progression look like?<br>
-- Foreman = gatekeeper of information, source of quality control (when quality is not incredibly obvious)<br>
-- Who supervises? Who settles disputes?<br>
-- What replaces the foreman? Usually, unions.</p>
<p>Fairness problems.<br>
Scientific management purports to increase the size of the pie without concern for how it gets divided. Early descriptions: labor keeps half of surplus.<br>
But Schmidt example from Taylor's congressional testimony: output increases by 3.6x, wage to labor increases by 1.6x =&gt; gains tend to go to capital<br>
More broadly, we tend to specialize the &quot;Planning Department&quot; in things like management consulting practices --- outsiders and senior management capture tons of rent from any improvement in productivity...</p>
<p>So how does this end?<br>
<a href="../../img/tayloroutcomes.jpg"><img src="../../img/tayloroutcomes-1024x772.jpg" alt="" title="tayloroutcomes"></a><br>
Game theory: Can we get to top-left quartile?<br>
-- Empirically, tendency for management to extract as much surplus as possible (push towards top-right quartile). Management is usually concentrated; labor tends to be fragmented...<br>
-- Backlash from labor: organize/unionize and push towards bottom-left quartile.</p>
