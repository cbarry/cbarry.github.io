      <h1>Option Backdating at UnitedHealth (BAV, Wednesday, Week 9)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-03-28">28 Mar 2012</time><a href="/tags/bav/" class="post-tag">bav</a>

<p>CEO compensation for Bill McGuire: - &quot;extraordinary&quot; =&gt; cash salary/bonus = $45M, options = $300M - BUT he built UnitedHealth. Market cap has grown by a factor of 50 under his tenure (1991-2005); shareholders overwhelmingly approve of him and his compensation package.</p>
<p>How to account for stock options? Fair value. Intrinsic value: - Expense = 0 (non-cash charge) - Footnote on annual report - Appears as dilution.</p>
<p>Fair value: - Comparability between firms - Matching principal (&quot;cost&quot; of options spread over vesting period) - Use options pricing methodology (Black Scholes) to value options at issuance</p>
<p>To other huge problem: backdating. Retroactive choice of grant date =&gt; greater dilution for shareholders, greater moral hazard Is it illegal? No, not if it's transparent -- just issuing options at below-market strike price... Another controversial trend: &quot;spring loading&quot; =&gt; timing options issuance to immediately precede good news</p>
<p>Is this a big deal for UnitedHealth? Should it impact valuation? Market cap declines by $20B. Impact of backdating: maybe $400M. Maybe fundamentals unaffected, but: Management distraction from lawsuit, SEC investigation, trust in management/board (worse because UnitedHealth is an insurer), possible departure of high-performing CEO, political pressure, etc. A fine mess...</p>
