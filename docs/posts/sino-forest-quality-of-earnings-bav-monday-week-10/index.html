      <h1>Sino-Forest / Quality of Earnings (BAV, Monday, Week 10)</h1>

<p>The Buy Story for Sino-Forest: - Better than competitors - Incredibly growth, booming demand - Good relationship with Chinese government</p>
<p>How good are the financial statements? Lots of negatives: - Unclear how they make money. - Unclear how to value assets: impairment factors? control over assets? - Huge jump in A/R, concentrated customers, weird customers (&quot;Affiliated Intermediaries&quot;). - No allowance for doubtful accounts. - Related-party transactions. - Weird tax position. BUT: - Tons of cash ($1.2B) - Solid operating cash flow</p>
<p>Two sources of uncertainty: GOVERNANCE: auditor moral hazard, Canadian accounting firm. FINANCIALS: How good is earnings quality? Will revenue convert to cash?</p>
<p>Big takeaway: Earnings quality analysis can raise concerns. But concerns are different from fraud allegations, and we usually can't discern fraud from financial statements alone.</p>
