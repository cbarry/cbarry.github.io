<p>Why do people play games in the real world?<br>
-- Escape reality, kill time<br>
-- Develop mastery, pursue achievements<br>
-- Competition =&gt; with friends!<br>
-- Structure interaction with friends =&gt; both acquaintances (get to know people better) and close friends (excuse to spend time together)<br>
Problems: maybe hard, maybe boring, losing is no fun, scheduling challenges</p>
<p>Zynga uses of Facebook Platform:<br>
==&gt; Pro-social engineering<br>
-- Go and help your friends harvest some eggplant! =&gt; cooperative, building together<br>
-- Friends will drive game selection =&gt; play with your buddies<br>
==&gt; Anti-social engineering<br>
-- Constant barrage of FarmVille posts =&gt; game may cost you a friendship</p>
<p>The business consequences:<br>
1. Free customer acquisition via newsfeed and direct message (awkward?)<br>
2. Heightened retention: &quot;Come and help me out!&quot; =&gt; aided by game elements: the games are easy and simplistic and bad.</p>
<p>A great social strategy: eBay Group Buying<br>
1. User X opts-in<br>
2. User X picks a gift for User Y<br>
3. eBay posts group buying message on User X's profile: visible to mutual friends of X and Y; invisible to Y<br>
Business outcome: avg successful gift has 4.2 participants, sells for 5x avg eBay sale price =&gt; people spend more money if they're spending it with their friends (solves social failures)<br>
Side benefits: participants return to eBay site 4x on average, one-third of participants open a new PayPal account.<br>
With zero marginal cost to eBay!</p>
