<p>Why do people play games in the real world? - Escape reality, kill time - Develop mastery, pursue achievements - Competition =&gt; with friends! - Structure interaction with friends =&gt; both acquaintances (get to know people better) and close friends (excuse to spend time together) Problems: maybe hard, maybe boring, losing is no fun, scheduling challenges</p>
<p>Zynga uses of Facebook Platform: ==&gt; Pro-social engineering - Go and help your friends harvest some eggplant! =&gt; cooperative, building together - Friends will drive game selection =&gt; play with your buddies ==&gt; Anti-social engineering - Constant barrage of FarmVille posts =&gt; game may cost you a friendship</p>
<p>The business consequences: 1. Free customer acquisition via newsfeed and direct message (awkward?) 2. Heightened retention: &quot;Come and help me out!&quot; =&gt; aided by game elements: the games are easy and simplistic and bad.</p>
<p>A great social strategy: eBay Group Buying 1. User X opts-in 2. User X picks a gift for User Y 3. eBay posts group buying message on User X's profile: visible to mutual friends of X and Y; invisible to Y Business outcome: avg successful gift has 4.2 participants, sells for 5x avg eBay sale price =&gt; people spend more money if they're spending it with their friends (solves social failures) Side benefits: participants return to eBay site 4x on average, one-third of participants open a new PayPal account. With zero marginal cost to eBay!</p>
