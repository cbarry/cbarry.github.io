<p>When J.D. Rockefeller's wealth peaked in 1912, he was worth $900M --- 2% of U.S. GDP.<br>
He would've been about five times as wealthy as Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Humble beginnings: started off as a bookkeeper for a Cleveland produce shipper.</p>
<p>Big accomplishment: takes oil from a land-grab business to a tightly-controlled empire.<br>
Old industry (ca. 1860) = no production controls, no experts, no regulation, low barriers to entry, huge boom/bust cycles to due variability in production (bad incentives), short-lived cartels</p>
<p>Standard empire (ca. 1878) = ridiculous economies of scale, skilled managerial team, consolidation both upstream and downstream, order to chaos.</p>
<p>1863 == Standard oil marketshare = 0%<br>
1872 == Standard oil marketshare = 25%<br>
1878 == Standard oil marketshare = 90%</p>
<p>Was it brains or luck?<br>
Or, &quot;Was it inevitable that someone would horizontally and vertically consolidate the oil business, or was Rockefeller's success due to a series of brilliant strategic decisions?&quot;<br>
Probably some of both.</p>
