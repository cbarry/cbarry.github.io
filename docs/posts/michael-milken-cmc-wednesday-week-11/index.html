<p>Michael Milken: savior of American growth or common criminal?</p>
<p>America in the 1970s/80s: - Deregulation, shift from manufacturing to service economy - Poorly-run large companies (maybe) - Future growth: small, riskier companies - Inflation drops in early '80s === Trend: Replacement Cost &gt; Market Value === - Discount factor =&gt; Stock market is undervalued? Complacent big companies? Suboptimal capital structures? - Focus on high agency costs =&gt; Notion of &quot;shareholder value&quot; develops, backlash against managerial complacency. Decline of managerial capitalism??</p>
<p>And so, junk bonds: Serve investor with higher risk appetite; betting on credit risk, not interest rates Drexel takes the lead as market-maker MILKEN =&gt; foresight to realize that smaller firms need access to debt</p>
<p>Sounds great. So what goes wrong? <a href="http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milken1.jpg"><img src="images/milken1-1024x672.jpg" alt="" title="milken"></a></p>
<p>How does Milken maintain power? - Charisma, personal loyalty, cult of personality - He makes money for EVERYONE - Informational advantage - Due diligence capability, pricing - Network - Underwriting: Drexel buys full issue - ONE-MAN MARKET</p>
<p>Consequences: Presages rise of financial instruments. Wave of MBOs and LBOs. Decline of old-style managerial capitalism Democratization of capital ... and then the savings and loan crisis.</p>
