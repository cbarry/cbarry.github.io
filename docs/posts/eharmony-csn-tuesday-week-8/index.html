<p>Three key activities in every search process: breadth, search, interaction (BSI)</p>
<p>For any search activity, there are three basic models. You can find potential spouses via: Your social network: Activities (work, school) =====&gt; bad breadth (small pool, homogenous) =====&gt; easy search (good knowledge about potential partners) =====&gt; easy interaction (already many excuses to talk)</p>
<p>Others' networks: Brokered (friends, parents) =====&gt; okay breadth (bigger pool than your own acquaintances) =====&gt; okay search (rely on others decision-making) =====&gt; okay interaction (broker can help determine potential partner's interest/availability)</p>
<p>Chance: Bars (or walking down the street, etc.) =====&gt; excellent breadth =====&gt; bad search (hard to discern compatibility/&quot;quality&quot;) =====&gt; bad interaction (hard to &quot;make a move&quot;/creepy, social repercussions, gender norms, etc.)</p>
<p>In online dating ====&gt; Facebook = Activity, eHarmony = Brokered, Match/OkCupid = Bars. Corollary: if you see a search process where one of these three classes of interaction does not exist, it's a business opportunity.</p>
<p>eHarmony Key Factors to Success: - High barriers to entry (long survey, expensive fee, reject &quot;bad&quot; applicants) - Matching algorithm (better matches [?], limited choices = easier to pick, lessens social stigma of reaching out) - Limited communication (avoids feast-or-famine problems [women with attractive photos get deluged with messages], increases odds of a response [because the other party doesn't have tons of choice either]) - Guided Communication (answer important questions [location? kids?] early)</p>
<p>But you still need bodies on the platform! And tons of challenges with marketing -- dating is scary/uncertain. Compare with picking a hair-care product: &quot;If you want to buy shampoo, the shampoo bottle is like, 'Uh-huh, I'm going home with you!'&quot; - Misiek</p>
<p>Word-of-mouth advertising doesn't work well; no one wants to tell their friends they are using an online dating service... So customer acquisition cost tends to be very high: ad spend for big sites on the order of 40% of revenue.</p>
