<p>In 2005, LinkedIn has 5M subscribers and needs to start monetizing. Offer &quot;premium&quot; accounts with better search, or offer paid messaging to people outside your network?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hiring problems that LinkedIn solves &lt;&lt; Search: In offline world, recruiters ask friends/contacts if they know anyone with qualification X. Several referrals (talk to my friend at company Y, ask her if she knows anyone) gets them to a candidate. - Incentive to act: middle links in referral chain have no vested interest in success of search - Recruiters can't ask too often; it gets annoying - Middle links in referral chain have to vouch for strangers - Referral chain is not clear; recruiters need to know who to ask At the time, LinkedIn has 5M members, but average &quot;reach&quot; (members within four connections) is only 50K! Search is not working great. Solution: convert from original model (brokered meet platform) to a bar. Solves other problems for job seekers: - Might not be looking for a job (busy; don't know what opportunities are available) - Sends adverse message to current employer: it's not okay to be job seeking</p>
