<p>A way to think about modularity and interdependence in the value chain: - Modularity is conformable (like mortar or clay) - Interdependence is solid (like bricks) Buildings (and value chains) are built with alternating layers.</p>
<p>Thus (for semiconductors): Fab Equipment = Interdependent (ex. Teradyne) Fabrication =&gt; Modular (?) Microprocessor design =&gt; Interdependent (ex. Intel) Laptops =&gt; Modular (ex. Dell)</p>
<p>Two interdependent companies don't usually work well together. Need a layer of modularity...</p>

<p>If you're a big company, think carefully before you outsource the hard stuff.</p>
<p>One idea: NetFlix needs the best suggestion engine in the world. They offer $1M reward to the best submission. Some random dude outside firm develops best engine; NetFlix suggestion engine is ridiculously good/shapes business model. Obviously hard to do this for everything, but...</p>
