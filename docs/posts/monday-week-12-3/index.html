<p>A way to think about modularity and interdependence in the value chain:<br>
-- Modularity is conformable (like mortar or clay)<br>
-- Interdependence is solid (like bricks)<br>
Buildings (and value chains) are built with alternating layers.</p>
<p>Thus (for semiconductors):<br>
Fab Equipment = Interdependent (ex. Teradyne)<br>
Fabrication =&gt; Modular (?)<br>
Microprocessor design =&gt; Interdependent (ex. Intel)<br>
Laptops =&gt; Modular (ex. Dell)</p>
<p>Two interdependent companies don't usually work well together. Need a layer of modularity...</p>
<p>BIG Idea Group =&gt; Fabulous business model but awful for customers. Mattel, et al. is outsourcing their highest value-add activity --- commoditizing themselves.<br>
Personal opinion: &quot;core competency&quot; counter-argument (Mattel's core competency is marketing!) is irrelevant and facile; the profits in the industry won't accrue to marketing given industry structure.</p>
<p>Big company executive: &quot;We're just not innovative enough!&quot; =&gt; Actually, all of your downstream activities shape/limit what comes out of the bottom of the funnel.</p>
<p>If you're a big company, think carefully before you outsource the hard stuff.</p>
<p>One idea: NetFlix needs the best suggestion engine in the world. They offer $1M reward to the best submission. Some random dude outside firm develops best engine; NetFlix suggestion engine is ridiculously good/shapes business model.<br>
Obviously hard to do this for everything, but...</p>
