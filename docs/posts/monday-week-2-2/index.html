<p>It can be really hard to test some hypotheses around demand in B2B startups - Will eHarmony or <a href="http://Match.com">Match.com</a> buy an algorithm? They'll always SAY they're interested... - Explicitly list out hypotheses; figure out a test to validate or reject. Good ideas &gt;&gt;&gt; Can we either fake or mechanical-turk this complex feature to figure out whether people will buy it? &gt;&gt;&gt; Can we gauge interest by making people do something costly (hand over their e-mail address)?</p>
<p>It is really hard to develop an MVP for products with strong network effects (i.e. dating websites, two-sided markets, etc.).</p>
<p>Given that your ability to run experiments drives the pace of your development, it's hard to move fast without a bunch of customers. How many A/B tests can you do with 100 users?</p>
<p>You can hide crappy users to boost perceived user quality (hi Quora).</p>
<p>You get one round of good PR when you raise money. Use it wisely.</p>
<p>Sunil Nagaraj on Facebook platform: - By the time you hear about a new feature on Facebook and you think you're early in exploiting it, you are already too late. - The only people who seem to win on Facebook apps are those who read Terms of Service incredibly closely -- and then do exploit them by toeing the line of what is permissible.</p>
