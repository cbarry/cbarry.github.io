<p>Not sure I agree with a lot of the take-aways, but...</p>
<p>Figure out where your organization stands, because it will determine (1) how easy it will be to adapt to change and (2) what tools will be effective within the organization:<br>

<p>Upper-right organizations are resistant to change (Apple in the 80s).<br>
How does this happen? The causal mechanism for developing a culture is repeated success.<br>
Similarly, the causal mechanism for breaking down a culture is stress or failure.</p>
<p>So how do leaders change an organization that is running fine right now but is not equipped for the future?<br>
Establish a sense of urgency? Break organization into smaller BUs, set goals, delegate responsibility, cut ruthlessly (standard BSSE answer)?<br>
It's not easy to do.<br>
Strong argument that Jobs would have sunk the ship just as thoroughly as Sculley/Spindler/Amelio --- Apple needed to experience serious trauma to break down the culture of making &quot;elegant PCs at whatever the cost&quot; (in the words of Gassee). Only on the brink of bankruptcy could a CEO dramatically shift the organization's priorities...</p>
<p>I don't buy it.<br>
Too deterministic and at odds with everything I have seen about leadership in the actual world. Some people can convince others to do things they would prefer not to do. Other people can't.<br>
Serious, quantifiable failure is not the only casual mechanism for change (although failure is a great teacher).</p>
