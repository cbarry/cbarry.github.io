<p>Cliffs Notes: Maslow is wrong; everyone grasps for actualization.</p>
<p>The things that make people satisfied with their jobs (motivation) are different in kind from the things that make people dissatisfied with their jobs (hygiene).</p>
<p>Job security, good salary, fringe benefits, pleasant boss = hygiene =&gt; lack of dissatisfaction<br>
But more salary doesn't make people more excited about their job.<br>
Accountability, new tasks, feedback on performance = motivation/actualization =&gt; satisfaction</p>
<p>Takeaway from Chinese manufacturing plant (variant on Foxconn):<br>
Formal ecosystems can emerge that are very different from what upper-level management intends. Huge division between direct and indirect labor, serious barriers to bottom-up improvement =&gt; NOT ideal for a self-professed lean manufacturing facility.</p>
<p>KITA (Kick in the Ass) inspires movement, not motivation. Even positive reinforcement (incentive compensation) only inspires movement.</p>
<p>Why do Chinese assembly line workers with tenuous, incredibly desirable jobs break the SOP to increase plant efficiency? They realize no material reward, and they'll be fired if they're discovered.<br>
Answer: Everyone wants self-actualization. Even if their physiological and security needs are not met...</p>
