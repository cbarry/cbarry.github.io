<p>Commoditization at some point in the value chain usually doesn't destroy profitability; just shifts it to some other player in the value chain. Example: when RAM manufacturing gets commoditized, profits shift down value chain to computer re-sellers.</p>
<p>&quot;A population can evolve, but the individuals within it do not.&quot; - Clay Example: IBM shifts from a mainframe manufacturer to a minicomputer manufacturer to a personal computer manufacturer. Individual business units associated with each activity die off; umbrella firm remains.</p>
<p>Two kinds of mergers: Leverage my Business Model (LBM) =&gt; Buyer feeds acquired firms' resources into existing business model. Integration and dissolution. Reinvent my Business Model (RBM) =&gt; Buyer attempts to change from stalled business model to acquired firms' successful business model. Can't just integrate resources. But might produce outsized returns.</p>
<p>Be wary of: &quot;We're buying their business model, but we're actually going to get their resources.&quot; - Steve Kaufman</p>
<p>B.J. Hess on whether a firm actually cares about its people: &quot;Check the bathrooms.&quot; =&gt; Locks on stalls? Soap in dispensers?</p>
<p>B.J. Hess' Post-Merger Integration checklist: (1) Find all the people who have been at firm for 10+ years, and ask them: - What do you value most about this company? =&gt; culture - Who do you turn to when you have a problem? =&gt; critical people; usually not reflected on org chart (2) Secure the customers.</p>
