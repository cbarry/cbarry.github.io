<p>Financial analysis challenge: separate operating effects from financing effects. Also, I never want to be an equity research analyst (even though this class is actually pretty interesting)</p>
<p>FedEx =&gt; All operating leases, reduces net income a little but dramatically understates size of total asset base ($8B in &quot;hidden&quot; assets). On the other hand, impact on ROE is minimal. Why capital leases make sense: conservative/accurate approach to leverage and firm's ability to take on debt.</p>
<p>One-time events sometimes swamp &quot;real&quot; performance - UPS strike kills profitability in one FY - FedEx acquisition of RPS dramatically changes cost structure in another FY</p>
<p>Condensing the income statement: four key metrics - Sales - Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT) = Net Income + Net Interest Expense (after taxes) ==&gt; Earnings on Net Operating Assets; driven by sales growth - Net Interest Expense After Taxes = (Interest Expense - Interest Income) x (1 - Tax Rate) ==&gt; After-tax cost of Net Debt; driven by leverage and financing costs - Net Income ======&gt; Separates operating net income from effects of capital structure</p>
<p>Condensing the balance sheet: four key components Total Net Operating Assets (1) Net Working Capital =&gt; minimal economies of scale (2) Net Long-Term Assets =&gt; potential economies of scale</p>
<p>Total Capital (financing) (3) Net Debt (interest bearing) =&gt; drives interest expense (4) Equity =&gt; residual claim on earnings</p>
