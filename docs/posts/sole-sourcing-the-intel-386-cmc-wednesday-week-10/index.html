      <h1>Sole-Sourcing the Intel 386 (CMC, Wednesday, Week 10)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-04-04">04 Apr 2012</time><a href="/tags/coming-of-managerial-capitalism/" class="post-tag">coming-of-managerial-capitalism</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>In 1987, a smallish component supplier called Intel unveils the 80386 processor and --- in a break with industry tradition --- announces that it will not license the chip for manufacture by other second-source suppliers (AMD, National Semi, etc.). IBM, the colossus that invented the personal computer, decides not to buy initially.<br>
Intel goes on to build a massive franchise. IBM gets crushed by clones and eventually exits the personal computer business altogether in 2005. Huh?</p>
<p>Value migration: IBM to Intel<br>
IBM: closed system, no interoperability, outsourced components, bets on BIOS (bad decision)<br>
Intel: second-sourcing to boost sales of architecture (becomes increasingly unfeasible at R&amp;D costs rise), backwards-compatibility, continuous investment in R&amp;D<br>
Classic story of modularity and interdependence (see BSSE).</p>
<p>Was this inevitable? Probably not.<br>
Uncertainty over use (Apple ad: &quot;What would you do with a personal computer?&quot;)<br>
Uncertainty over performance-defining sub-component<br>
Changing IP protections<br>
Purposeful decision by Intel to license initially and convince competitors to stop R&amp;D investment<br>
Operational challenges for Intel in meeting demand themselves (fabs = high fixed cost, long lag to build)<br>
Semi-conductor slump begins in 1984 --- Intel has been performing terribly for two consecutive years; might want to avoid &quot;bet the company&quot; decisions</p>
<p>Larger observation: Intel and Microsoft represent a shift from the old model of how firms build massive monopolies.<br>

<p>Rockefeller starts by dominating refining --- one part of the value chain in oil (horizontal integration). Then expands into marketing, transport, exploration, etc., because it makes sense --- Standard Oil can reap all the benefits of improvement in these steps.</p>
<p>Intel starts by integrating across design, manufacture, and even branding/marketing of processors (AMD advertises Intel architecture). Then lays waste to all competitors in manufacture.</p>
<p>Why?<br>
-- Change in customer profile (consumers buy on brand)<br>
-- Democratization of capital (this strategy needs $ upfront)<br>
-- Shift to knowledge goods, where scaling up is easier and cheaper --- if you've got the chip everyone wants, it's not impossible to rapidly double production and double unit sales. Compare to Standard Oil, which cannot quickly double its output.<br>
-- Related to knowledge goods, intellectual property protection conveys government-sanctioned horizontal monopoly.<br>
-- Network effects/demand-side economies of scale. Intel processors are much more valuable to a consumer if everyone else uses them and writes code for them. My oil isn't inherently any more useful if my neighbor buys from the same refiner.</p>
<p>(Push-back: Did Intel really go vertical first? I'm not sure --- it seems like they went horizontal first, establishing dominance in processor design/R&amp;D before they made a play to be sole-suppliers.)</p>
