<p>The main competitor for meet platforms? Reality -- it's pretty good.</p>
<p>Twitter: started as a friend platform, now mostly a meet platform.</p>
<p>Meet vs. friend platforms: <a href="http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/meetvsfriend.jpg"><img src="images/meetvsfriend-1024x606.jpg" alt="" title="meetvsfriend"></a> May be a false dichotomy because most meet platforms use &quot;friend features,&quot; too.</p>
<p>Twitter's Breadth: 500M users now! How? - SxSW launch =&gt; Misconception. Look at user count; basically doesn't change... - Celebrities =&gt; Yes, but mass adoption did not happen when first celebs hopped on. - WoM =&gt; Not really. - Media! =&gt; Twitter provides natural complement for old media: timely reaction to events; new source of news; instant dialogue. Big bumps from Rick Sanchez Live, Mumbai bombing, and Beijing Olympics. Twitter unintentionally created a platform that was a natural complement to network news.</p>
<p>Lesson: Borrow someone else's traffic. Create a platform that serves as a natural complement a pre-existing, high-traffic platform.</p>
<p>Twitter's Search: Terrible. Hard to find people, no guidance, no response to most tweets, hard/not natural to post recycled content (compare to Pinterest or Foursquare). Hashtags are rarely used (3% of tweets). &quot;You are more likely to get a message as a man on OkayCupid than to get a follower on Twitter.&quot;</p>
<p>Interaction: Really hard/unintuitive.</p>
<p>How to monetize? Ummm.... Ads: targeted discounts/tweets? No one hears you, and users have no purchase intent. Data: sell analytics? We don't know who Twitter users actually are; minimal demographic information and sentiment analysis via Twitter is notoriously unreliable. Other options are no good either...</p>
