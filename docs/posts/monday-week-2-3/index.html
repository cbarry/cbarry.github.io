<p>Assets vs. expenses (or, when can I capitalize?) - Use the matching principal as a general guide, but also think about the relative size of the asset. If half of your balance sheet is capitalized marketing, people will start asking questions. - Can be a challenge for rapidly-growing firms -- lots of growth + aggressive capitalization = tends to overstates profitability</p>
<p>All assets have uncertain future benefits (cash due to inflation, receivables due to bad debt, tangible assets due to uncertainty of future cash flows) - Trade-off between relevance and reliability - Think about fair value (and possibility of a big impairment), think about timeline for depreciation/amortization</p>
<p>If you're a public company, put everything in the notes to your financial statements. That way, at least you can claim that people could've un-done all of your &quot;managerial judgment&quot;-type accounting decisions.</p>
