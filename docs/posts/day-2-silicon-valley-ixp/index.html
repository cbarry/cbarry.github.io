<p>James Slavet/Adam Nash (Greylock), &quot;State of the Space&quot; on Consumer Internet<br>
What's an Entrepreneur-in-Residence?\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone working on their 'next big thing' at a VC firm. Uses VC office space, gets exposure to VC dealflow.<br>
Usually no formal expectation that the VC firm will invest.<br>
Usually unpaid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's an Executive-in-Residence?\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone looking for their next CEO role; usually takes 6-10 months to find.<br>
Gets exposure to VC dealflow.<br>
Usually is paid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Greylock only invests in software; segments investments into consumer and enterprise.<br>
Basic investment theses: social graph, mobile, Big Data</p>
<p>&quot;The iPhone broke open enterprise IT departments.&quot; -- Adam Nash</p>
<p>Three basic models to monetize consumer:<br>
Advertising &gt; Out of vogue; need either 100M users or 30M users who are super-desirable or somehow specialized in their needs.<br>
Subscription &gt; Lends itself to analytics; usually very high-margin.<br>
Transactions/commerce &gt; Traditionally hard, but wave of interesting new startups. Key changes: more like subscription in terms of customer stickiness; maybe not holding inventory.</p>
<p>The depressing math about outcomes:<br>
-- There are two new companies a year worth &gt; $1B<br>
-- There are 15-20 new companies a year worth &gt; $100-200M</p>
<p>Internally, most big VCs invest to make a $50M cash return. Think about financing through that lens, because it's how VC investors are thinking about it...</p>
<p>PunchTab Case<br>
Major, enduring takeaway: Silicon Valley thrives on reputation, track record, and signaling.</p>
<p>Nick Sturiale: don't bootstrap; liquidity takes forever (8-10 years for a successful exit).</p>
<p>Seed-round term sheets are always negotiable. You'll need an A Round from somewhere...</p>
<p>Lessons learned from Mike Cassidy<br>
Speed wins. Fast product rollouts make it hard for competitors to keep up, build morale, and give you good PR.</p>
<p>On biz dev: Deals close fast or not at all. &quot;The probability of a deal closing declines by 10% each day that the deal doesn't close.&quot;</p>
<p>Viral coefficient = X x Y x Z<br>
where X = % of users exposed to trial<br>
Y = % of users who invite friends<br>
Z = Average # of friends invited</p>
<p>If viral coefficient &gt; 1, you can do short-hand math to see that user acquisition happens incredibly fast.<br>
Example: 1.02 =&gt; rule of 72 implies that number of users doubles every 36 days.</p>
<p>On pitching a product without actually having a product:<br>
-- Get &quot;If...than&quot; commitments from customers (If you built this product, I would buy X units).<br>
-- Figure out how you'd build it (team, Gantt chart for development timeline, etc.).</p>
<p>Huge takeaway: there are some people (Mike Cassidy) who think about the world in a very different way from me. And sometimes they build $500M companies in under 500 days. And I am impressed.</p>
<p>Twitter company visit (Satya Patel, VP of Product)<br>
<a href="../../img/IMG_0524.jpg"><img src="../../img/IMG_0524-300x224.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0524"></a><br>
Twitter's competition (broadly): anyone consuming users' time<br>
Twitter is a &quot;many-to-many&quot; medium</p>
<p>Truths:<br>
-- It is very hard to change consumer behavior.<br>
-- Successful Internet businesses address one single use case very well.</p>
<p>Model for thinking about Twitter users:<br>
Activation =&gt; Consumption =&gt; Engagement =&gt; Creation<br>
(I have previously heard this as segmenting user base into consumers, curators, and creators)</p>
<p>Twitter has seven core values (didn't actually go through all of them):<br>
-- Ship it.<br>
-- Simplify.<br>
-- Passion and personality matter.</p>
<p>Thinking about the PM role: product management is an editorial function. PMs are primarily curators.<br>
Engineering lead on a Twitter team runs daily scrums.</p>
<p>Cloudflare company visit (Michelle Zatlyn, Matthew Prince)<br>
Think about building awareness when you announce new products. Cloudflare launched at TechCrunch disrupt; benefitted from winning HBS business plan competition.<br>
Announcing a financing round is free publicity. You should do it when you need publicity, NOT as soon as you close the round. Inevitable TechCrunch write-up helps hiring, don't announce financing just to stoke your egos.</p>
<p>To think about: in an early-stage venture, what you are worth is in part a function of how much money you raise.</p>
<p>Think about how your financers view the world: Monday morning VC partners meeting; weekly &quot;news cycle&quot; within venture firms, outside investors need to justify everything to their partners/colleagues. Make their lives easier.</p>
<p>A macro thesis about the world: Internet publishers still cannot monetize their content effectively. This must change.</p>
<p>thredUP company visit (James Reinhart, Chris Homer)<br>
Started as &quot;Netflix for shirts!&quot;</p>
<p>One basic demo tool: print out wireframes, sit down with a user and let them &quot;click through.&quot;</p>
<p>Tools for customer feedback:<br>
-- Moms on staff!<br>
-- Vibrant Facebook community =&gt; Easy to ask questions about product decisions. But are the answers always right? Users don't like change...</p>
<p>&quot;Good products don't distribute themselves.&quot;<br>
Secular tendency for startups to ignore the importance of go-to-market and focus exclusively on how to build the &quot;right&quot; product.<br>
Some business models require a lot of press to acquire customers, and it's hard to get good customer observation without enough early adopters. Chase reporters if necessary; get familiar with bloggers and news sources that your customers use.</p>
