<p>Vietnam: remarkable growth since first moves away from centrally-planned economy in 1987. Will growth continue?</p>
<p>How a communist country maintained 7.7% GDP growth for 34 years (1986-2010): - Started out poor (ninth-poorest country in the world circa '86) - Favorable investment policies (allowed foreign ownership, opened to FDI, simplified permitting, EPZs, etc.) - Favorable macro policies (convertible currency [mostly], property rights, diplomatic normalization/&quot;became a good citizen&quot;) - Cold War ends =&gt; can't rely on aid from Russia anymore (Counterpoint: start relying on aid from Western world...) - Riding wave of regional prosperity (neighbors grow even faster!) - Stable, centralized government - Consistent and slow privatization (&quot;equitization&quot;)</p>
<p>Concerns moving forward: - Privatizing SOEs =&gt; Pace has been slow so far. Is it really necessary? Can government make it happen? - Bad higher education, bad infrastructure, etc. - Corrupt (sort of). - Inflation, real estate bubble (?), general macro worries. - Immature clusters.</p>
<p>===&gt; Big takeaways &lt;=== Social and economic policy are inextricably linked. Old-school guidance to developing nations -- implement Washington Consensus ASAP -- doesn't usually get implemented right/looks flawed. The European Union: whatever its failings, EU did an incredible job at getting tons of countries to enact economic/governance reforms. Required for membership!</p>
