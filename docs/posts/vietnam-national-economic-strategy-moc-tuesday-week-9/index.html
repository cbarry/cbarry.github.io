<p>Vietnam: remarkable growth since first moves away from centrally-planned economy in 1987. Will growth continue?</p>
<p>How a communist country maintained 7.7% GDP growth for 34 years (1986-2010):<br>
-- Started out poor (ninth-poorest country in the world circa '86)<br>
-- Favorable investment policies (allowed foreign ownership, opened to FDI, simplified permitting, EPZs, etc.)<br>
-- Favorable macro policies (convertible currency [mostly], property rights, diplomatic normalization/&quot;became a good citizen&quot;)<br>
-- Cold War ends =&gt; can't rely on aid from Russia anymore (Counterpoint: start relying on aid from Western world...)<br>
-- Riding wave of regional prosperity (neighbors grow even faster!)<br>
-- Stable, centralized government<br>
-- Consistent and slow privatization (&quot;equitization&quot;)</p>
<p>Concerns moving forward:<br>
-- Privatizing SOEs =&gt; Pace has been slow so far. Is it really necessary? Can government make it happen?<br>
-- Bad higher education, bad infrastructure, etc.<br>
-- Corrupt (sort of).<br>
-- Inflation, real estate bubble (?), general macro worries.<br>
-- Immature clusters.</p>
<p>===&gt; Big takeaways &lt;=== Social and economic policy are inextricably linked. Old-school guidance to developing nations -- implement Washington Consensus ASAP -- doesn't usually get implemented right/looks flawed. The European Union: whatever its failings, EU did an incredible job at getting tons of countries to enact economic/governance reforms. Required for membership!</p>
