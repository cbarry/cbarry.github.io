      <h1>INNOVA-MEX; Mexican search fund (EF, Wednesday, Week 9)</h1>

<time datetime="2011-11-03">03 Nov 2011</time><a href="/tags/ef/" class="post-tag">ef</a>

<p>American search fund: a Mini-LBO. Returns from leverage in acquisition and operational improvements (margin expansion). Growth industry increases likelihood of good exit. Mexican search fund: a Mini-VC fund. Not much leverage; too risky to buy bad business and try a turnaround; primarily banking on either top-line growth or operational improvement/multiple expansion.</p>
<p>Challenges with non-American search funds: - Raising capital is hard. Bank debt is expensive or unavailable (niche between small-business loan and full-on LBO). - Macro environment risks. Currency risk for foreign investors, financial statements are unreliable, hard to find comparables for valuation. - Harder to find good targets. Culture resistance to selling businesses. - Investors are harder to find; model is not well understood. Need foreign investors to reassure Americans about the target; need American investors to reassure foreigners about the model.</p>
<p>Acquisition-stage =&gt; two-sided negotiation with fund investors (selling them on the target and the deal) and with seller. If seller wants a higher price, need to raise more equity =&gt; messy, non-obvious impact on returns for LPs and for searchers. Solutions: seller financing, earn-outs, seller retains some equity stake.</p>
