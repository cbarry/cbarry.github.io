<p>What is financial analysis?<br>
Identify key drivers of performance =&gt; assess past/present performance =&gt; determine whether firm is achieving its goals</p>
<p>Starts with understanding firm strategy (business model, risks, unique characteristics, competitors, lifecycle) and accounting choices.<br>
==&gt; If accounting choices do not reflect objectives/risks, maybe we should adjust to capture reality &quot;better.&quot;</p>
<p>Other hints for ratio analysis:<br>
-- Be careful about changes in firm's operations over time --- one-time items, new strategies, etc.<br>
-- Cross-sectional analysis (firm vs. competitors) --- Do firms in the same industry have the same strategy? Sometimes, but often not...<br>
-- Some items are often troublesome/hard to &quot;bucket&quot; (convertible securities on B/S, deferred taxes)</p>
<p>Thoughts on commodity firms<br>
-- Need to understand/scrutinize cyclicality and utilization =&gt; central to valuation<br>
-- Often huge changes in revenue without much change in assets<br>
-- Macro perspective/factors = usually significant<br>
-- Non-obvious insight: Commodity producers can do great when input prices rise IF demand is strong and supply/capacity is tight. Pass factor price increases on to customers...</p>
