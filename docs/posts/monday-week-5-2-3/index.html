<p>What is financial analysis? Identify key drivers of performance =&gt; assess past/present performance =&gt; determine whether firm is achieving its goals</p>
<p>Starts with understanding firm strategy (business model, risks, unique characteristics, competitors, lifecycle) and accounting choices. ==&gt; If accounting choices do not reflect objectives/risks, maybe we should adjust to capture reality &quot;better.&quot;</p>
<p>Other hints for ratio analysis: - Be careful about changes in firm's operations over time -- one-time items, new strategies, etc. - Cross-sectional analysis (firm vs. competitors) -- Do firms in the same industry have the same strategy? Sometimes, but often not... - Some items are often troublesome/hard to &quot;bucket&quot; (convertible securities on B/S, deferred taxes)</p>
<p>Thoughts on commodity firms - Need to understand/scrutinize cyclicality and utilization =&gt; central to valuation - Often huge changes in revenue without much change in assets - Macro perspective/factors = usually significant - Non-obvious insight: Commodity producers can do great when input prices rise IF demand is strong and supply/capacity is tight. Pass factor price increases on to customers...</p>
