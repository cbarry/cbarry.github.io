<p>Feudalism (socialism) or unbridled capitalism?<br>
-- Is American capitalism indelibly rooted in tragic inhumanity?<br>
-- Or was slavery mostly a social phenomenon that probably even hurt economic progress? Heat map of slave ownership in the U.S. in mid-19th century is, to this day, a mirror image of the most impoverished areas of the country.</p>
<p>Demographics of slavery<br>
-- Existed in the north, but one-third of southern population in 1860 was slave.<br>
-- Most slaves (esp before 1810) transported to Brazil and Caribbean, not U.S.<br>
-- &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;-style plantations were the exception. Mostly smaller-scale operations; only 385K slaveowners of 8.3M whites in slave states (~4.5%).<br>
-- In economic terms, labor treated as a capital good. Market price for slaves (before puberty, girls worth more; after puberty, boys worth more); some of the roots of accrual accounting are in keeping track of slaves.<br>
-- White life expectancy in America (1850): 40 years. Slave life expectancy (1850): 36 years. Life expectancy in Italy (1885): 35 years. Life expectancy in NYC/Boston/Philadelphia (1830): 24 years. ==&gt;&gt; slaves as assets, value in maximizing productive lifespan</p>
<p>Northern economic impact:<br>
Largest slave port in the country at turn of 19th century: Newport, RI<br>
Northern shipping and textile manufacturing =&gt; dependent on slavery for cheap cotton</p>
