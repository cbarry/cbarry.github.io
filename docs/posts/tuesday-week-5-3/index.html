<p>Splitting equity early: high ability to attract good co-founders, low incentive to build value Splitting equity late: low ability to attract good co-founders, high incentive to build value Ways to mitigate =&gt; vesting, other &quot;dynamic&quot; ways of dividing up equity (maybe based on performance)</p>
<p>Things ventures want from a board: - Objective perspective - Domain expertise/industry knowledge - Network to hires - Network to customers - Free time to think about company - Ability to negotiate with prospective investors VCs can do some of these things. In the best cases, VCs have resources/motivation to help. But ventures can sometimes do all of these things without outside investors. Things to think about: founders domain expertise/network, capital requirements, rich vs. king issues.</p>
