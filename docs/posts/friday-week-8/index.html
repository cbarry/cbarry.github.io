<p>Entrepreneurship in Germany (or, why Facebook didn't start in Munich): Cultural reasons: - Stigma about failure in business (deters smart people from attempting high-risk ventures) - No iconic role-models (Who is the German Steve Jobs?) - Conservative mindset</p>
<p>Institutional reasons: - Bankruptcy laws that favor creditors (Can't just leave the keys to your startup with your creditors and walk away) - Smaller, fragmented public markets =&gt; strategic sale is the only exit option =&gt; strategic buyers drive down valuations - Fewer large institutional investors =&gt; hard to raise VC funds; hard to syndicate investment with fewer investors - More rigid labor markets =&gt; hard to fire non-performers</p>
<p>Room for debate about whether the fundamental difference is institutional or cultural; obviously the two are connected.</p>
<p>Compare to Silicon Valley. Some huge differences: - California courts have basically invalidated the non-compete clause. Easy to leave Google and start a new venture... - Self-perpetuating system =&gt; smart people cluster around previous successes; infrastructure develops.</p>
<p>Upshot =&gt; European VC investors make stable, predictably profitable investments. Euro VC returns are mean-distributed. American VC investors shoot for the moon. Top quartile of American VCs exhibit incredible returns; the rest of the industry performs poorly.</p>
<p>Impact on inge/What does this mean for entrepreneurs? - Lots of corporate VC (with accompanying benefits and drawbacks) =&gt; large firms using their balance sheets to invest in startups; basically viewed as a substitute for R&amp;D spend - Large disparity between firm's valuation on a discounted cash-flow basis and valuation from transaction comparables; challenges for entrepreneurs around gaining liquidity - Hard to start capital-intensive businesses =&gt; ventures that might be viable in US have trouble when they need cash to scale up</p>
<p>Valuation with three-factor FCF model - EBITDA margins =&gt; look at implied fixed vs. variable cost % as reflected in historical financials - Asset intensity =&gt; look at length of sales cycle =&gt; drives OWC needs</p>
