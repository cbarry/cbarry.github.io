<p>&quot;The first 500 fans were a lot harder to get than the next 500,000.&quot; - Blair Fowler, YouTube celebrity</p>
<p>How did Blair Fowler and her sister become YouTube beauty fashionistas from their bedroom in Tennessee? Blair: first-mover advantage. In summer 2008, there were only four people putting beauty tutorials on YouTube. Last year, there were about 100,000 people on YouTube with four or more beauty videos. &quot;We could've been blogging about paper airplanes and there would've been people watching.&quot; [Maybe, I think she's ridiculously savvy]</p>
<p>Why is Blair successful? Her content is &quot;not just straight make-up videos -- people feel like I'm letting them into my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Tips on acquiring a massive followership: - Related your content to Twitter trending topics; post to Twitter under a trending hashtag - Figure out how to get people to send viral e-mails linking to your content. Run contests?</p>
<p>How much work does she actually do? &quot;One [ten-minute] video takes me one day, like from morning until night.&quot; &quot;I try to do one [video] per two days.&quot; Yeah, she works pretty hard, too...</p>
