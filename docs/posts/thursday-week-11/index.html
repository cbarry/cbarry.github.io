<p>Fascinating case, not sure about take-aways...<br>
Sal Khan cited authenticity as the &quot;core&quot; of Khan Academy's success. Other factors: bite-sized content (10-15 minute segments), totally brilliant and interesting presenter (Sal), tutoring vs. teaching model.</p>
<p>I'm worried about their transition to the big time. It seems as if Khan will have serious crossing-the-chasm problems that were not discussed in a way that made me comfortable.\</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Current user base: privileged high-school/college kids who WANT help learning math and science in a way that supplements formal instruction, without using a real tutor or asking their teachers for help.<br>
Targeted user base: middle-school kids in underperforming schools who may not want to learn math and science, coordinated through teachers/educational system, where completion/progress through lessons can be monitored.<br>
How are these the same jobs-to-be-done? Like, at all?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Still an incredibly impressive guy and meaningful mission. I was in awe.</p>
<p>&quot;I waited a long time before I quit my job.&quot; -- Sal Khan<br>
AND<br>
&quot;I didn't want to live off my savings for nine months, but it made for a great story.&quot; -- Sal Khan</p>
