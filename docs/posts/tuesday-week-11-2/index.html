      <h1>Phil Knight at Nike (FD, Tuesday, Week 11)</h1>

<time datetime="2011-11-16">16 Nov 2011</time><a href="/tags/founders-dilemmas/" class="post-tag">founders-dilemmas</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>Theories for why some people start massive, profitable companies and still retain control of them (rich and king):<br>
-- Luck<br>
-- Lightning strikes (something unusual about the opportunity that they were uniquely equipped to exploit)<br>
-- Great founder (just something different/superior about Gates, Jobs, Knight, and a few others)<br>
-- Creative decisions (somehow avoided the typical rich vs. king tradeoff)<br>
-- Structural (specific industry characteristics that enable rich and king)</p>
<p>Equity splits between partners:<br>
&quot;51% / 49%&quot; is not a tenable capital structure, and should set off warning bells. How will the 51% guy retain control when the firm must issue new equity for employees or investors? How readily will he give up control?<br>
Phil Knight basically retained majority/near-majority stake in Nike by bullying a series of early employees into selling their equity to him at shockingly discounts.</p>
<p>Homophily is sometimes a strength.<br>
Nike's early success was built on the back of unique insight into elite running. But that makes it harder to adapt when the world changes: junior employees foresee the rise of Reebok and aerobics, but can't effectively communicate to Nike leadership.</p>
