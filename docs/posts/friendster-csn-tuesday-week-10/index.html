<p>&quot;We had had the most effective user acquisition model in the history of history.&quot; -- Kent Lindstrom, Friendster</p>
<p>Key questions in developing a business strategy based on social networks:<br>
(1) Is there a real problem?<br>
(2) Can networks help?<br>
(3) Are networks better than alternatives?<br>
(4) Can you actually build a solution?<br>
(5) Are you the best platform?</p>
<p>Social failures are not necessarily moral problems --- we should not assume that solving social failures is always a &quot;good&quot; thing. Sometimes solving failures introduces new problems.<br>
Example: Facebook facilitates cheating on your spouse because it's much harder to have a wandering eye in the offline world. Social failure? Yes, people want their eyes to wander. &quot;Good&quot; thing? Maybe not.</p>
<p>How can Friendster monetize?<br>
Dating, social search, social product referrals, city-centric (social Craigslist, plan my social life), personal media platform.</p>
<p>Dating: lots of problems and potential for embarrassment; users don't have tons of connections.<br>
Social search: Good for subjective/local listings, no help for objective information. Which friends do we care about? Not clearly better than using past search history.<br>
Trusted referrals: Hard to elicit user-generated content without money (which messes up incentives). Which friends do we care about? Not useful for many goods.<br>
Trusted listings/social Craigslist: Market is shallow, not clear how network helps (and it may hurt).<br>
Plan my social life: Untapped (at the time), real potential. But privacy issues, lots of substitutes (email), and you need ALL friends on the platform.</p>
<p>Conclusion: This is really hard. Especially because the Friendster tech infrastructure is crumbling...</p>
