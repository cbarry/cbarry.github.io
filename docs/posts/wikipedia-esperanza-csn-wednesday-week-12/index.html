<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Esperanza">Wikipedia Esperanza</a>: should Wikipedians keep it or shutter it? What kind of problems arise on User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms?</p>
<p>Keep Esperanza<br>
Premise: retention is a problem.<br>
-- Quality of articles increases =&gt; pressure on editors to perform<br>
-- Helps retain editors and overcome negative stigmas (petty, flamewar-ridden community)<br>
-- Stress alerts work =&gt; Esperanza saved Bally!<br>
-- Aids in conflict resolution</p>
<p>Ditch Esperanza<br>
Premise: retention is not a problem.<br>
-- Esperanza focuses editors on quantity, not quality =&gt; keeps mediocre editors involved; they SHOULD leave<br>
-- Coffee lounge is a distraction =&gt; energy would be better put towards writing/editing<br>
-- NOT transparent =&gt; admin coaching; imposing artificial hierarchy<br>
-- Stress alerts don't work<br>
-- Engagement is NOT a problem =&gt; new editors joining in droves (611K editors in '06); attrition is minimal (90% of all editors are active); average number of edits is quite high (4.5 edits/mo)</p>
<p>How does Wikipedia resolve conflicts? Open debate; democratic (maybe) process. But:<br>
-- Violent fights/&quot;revert wars&quot; ==&gt; settle disputes, but demotivating to &quot;losers,&quot; who may stop contributing =&gt; BUT it feels good to correct people.<br>
-- Is conflict resolution process really good? Most persistent editor wins; high schoolers with free time trump judgment of professionals.</p>
<p>Who are Wikipedia editors?<br>
Usually nerds, usually white, write about tech more than &quot;culture.&quot; Socially awkward?<br>
Usually over-educated and underemployed.<br>
Usually care about the topic (activists?).<br>
Only 2% of editors are women, and half of them edit under a male-sounding name!</p>
<p>Takeaway: There are &quot;gendered&quot; technologies! Wikipedia: built by boys, for boys.</p>
<p>The big problem: correlation between write and read on Wikipedia = 0 (really. statistically.) Editors don't write more about the stuff that users actually look at.<br>
<a href="../../img/wiki.png"><img src="../../img/wiki.png" alt="" title="wiki"></a><br>
If we want a good encyclopedia, we need to move stuff from &quot;top left&quot; to &quot;top right&quot; --- Wikipedia is really bad for finding out about certain subjects (painting, some kinds of history).<br>
Compare to Yelp --- strong correlation between read/write, reviewers incentivized to produce content that actually gets read a lot (Elite status, compliments, etc.).</p>
<p>Takeaway: There are huge read/write problems with UGC platforms --- because people typically write for themselves/other editors, NOT readers.</p>
