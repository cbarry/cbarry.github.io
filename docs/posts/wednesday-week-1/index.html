      <h1>Bausch &amp; Lomb/Revenue Recognition (BAV, Wednesday, Week 1)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-01-26">26 Jan 2012</time><a href="/tags/bav/" class="post-tag">bav</a>

<p>The vast majority of accounting fraud involves revenue recognition.</p>
<p>Do companies play games with earnings? Duh, yes. <a href="http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/revenues.jpg"><img src="images/revenues-300x185.jpg" alt="" title="revenues"></a></p>
<p>Incentives to game: - Meeting/beating analysts' expectations pays off in share price, especially for &quot;habitual beaters&quot; - Markets reacts poorly to revenue surprises (especially for growth firms) - Resource allocation within firm - Personal compensation, promotion, etc.</p>
<p>Q: When do we recognize revenue? (first-year review) A: When it is (1) realized/realizable and (2) earned.</p>
<p>Warning signs for revenue recognition games: - Increase in days receivable - Long-term loans to customers (why are they happening?) or sales on consignment - Transactions that are not actually arm's length (i.e. Bausch &amp; Lomb took returns of contact lenses, even though they said they wouldn't) - Barter transactions or other transactions with lots of judgment involved (multiple deliverables, customer acceptance provisions, etc.) - Management under pressure to meet targets</p>
<p>Senior management at Bausch &amp; Lomb not convicted of fraud, but still guilty of creating an environment that encouraged fraud and failing to implement sufficient controls against fraud. Gulf between &quot;official&quot; company policy and side deals some employees made with distributors to permit returns, subsidize storage post-sale, etc.</p>
