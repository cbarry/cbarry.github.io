<p>Cluster: a geographically proximate group of interconnected companies and associated institutions in a particular field, linked by commonalities and complementarities ==&gt;&gt; Big deal: positive externalities associated with geography: - Drive increased productivity/operating efficiency (efficient access to specialized inputs, ease of coordination across firms, rapid diffusion of best practices, proximate rivals encourage differentiation) - Stimulate innovation (ease of experimentation, density eases recognition of unmet needs) - Facilitate new business formation (opportunities are apparent, concentrated demand encourages spinoffs, commercializing new products is easier)</p>
<p>&quot;So I really want competitors nearby??&quot; Porter argues yes. - More competition more opportunity. - Lose employees to spinoffs expanding supply of skilled people - Bid up costs larger local supplier base, increased flexibility/efficiency Most cluster participants are NOT direct competitors, firms end up differentiated. Not sure I buy it...</p>
<p>Why French wine cluster is stagnant: Inflexible government policies; protectionism =&gt; tons of fragmented little wineries; no incentive to innovate; stuck in the past/present Beware when industries are considered a &quot;national treasure&quot;</p>
