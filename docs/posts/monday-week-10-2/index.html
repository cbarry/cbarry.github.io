<p>&quot;Has anyone here ever worked at an investment bank? No one? Not one of you? Wow, we are blessed.&quot; - Bill Aulet</p>
<p>Subscription models/prepayment by customers: obviously results in negative NWC. But also means you have almost no bad debt!</p>
<p>A laundry list of revenue models: - One-time upfront charge (plus maintenance) - Licensing - Subscription/leasing - Shared savings - Consumables (razor/razorblade) - Operating and Maintenance (upfront cost = minimal) - Cost-plus =&gt; good when there is requirement risk; basically a partnership - Up-sell/High margin add-ons (Best Buy and warranties) - Advertising - Transaction percentage (investment banking) - Freemium (cute puppy; free for first three months) - Pay-as-you-go (cell phones; PPA in energy) - Utility model (per usage) - Franchise model - Micro-transactions (Second Life, Worlds of Warcraft) - Parking meter (make money on parking tickets)</p>
<p>In retailing, be aware of &quot;signpost items&quot; =&gt; known goods where your customers are attuned to the fair price (pack of cigarettes, galloon of milk, 12-pack of diapers)</p>
<p>&quot;Decoying&quot;/&quot;Anchoring&quot; =&gt; Add a high-end, premium-priced item to increase per-transaction revenue (putting Kobe steak and lobster entree on the menu at a restaurant)</p>
