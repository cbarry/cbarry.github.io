      <h1>Railroads and the Beginnings of Modern Management (CMC, Friday, Week 3)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-02-10">10 Feb 2012</time><a href="/tags/cmc/" class="post-tag">cmc</a>

<p>First huge-scale corporations in America: railroads. First railroads borrowed org structure heavily from the Napoleanic General Staff.</p>
<p>Railroad Mileage (U.S.)- 1800: ~0 mi. =&gt; NYC to Chicago = 6 weeks</p>
<ul>
<li>1830: 23 mi. =&gt; NYC to Chicago = 3 weeks</li>
<li>1850: 9,000 mi. =&gt; NYC to Chicago = 1.5 days</li>
<li>1870: 53,000 mi.</li>
<li>1890: 130,000 mi.</li>
</ul>
<p>Massively larger than textile mills. Erie Railroad = $2.5M in OpEx/year and 4,000 employees Pepperell Manufacturing (textile giant) = $300K in OpEx/year and 800 employees</p>
<p>Large enterprise and geographic distance require: - Data management and analysis - Understanding of costs (and drivers of cost) - Division of responsibilities - Organizational learning mechanisms In early years, railroads experienced DIS-economies of scale -- management practice (and, to a lesser degree, technology) had not caught up with the complexity of the enterprise.</p>
<p>New questions about relationship between business and government - Should railroads be public institutions? Massive scale... - Land grants =&gt; builders get checkerboard-style parcels of the land adjacent to the road IOT incentivize construction. - Free use of railroads by federal government (Lincoln implemented initial grant policy to help Union in Civil War) - Tariffs (Interstate Commerce Act) =&gt; railroads are the first truly national-level businesses.</p>
<p>Mind-boggling complex businesses require specialized managers: continued divorce of ownership from management/enterprise control (from whence &quot;The Coming of Managerial Capitalism&quot;).</p>
<p>Early roads (1855) Centralized control: one General Supervisor with 13 direct reports BUT continued problems with maintaining adequate supervision AND direct-reports are interdependent -- not independent -- entities.</p>
<p>Later roads (1890) Matrix organizations: President, several Vice Presidents, etc. Need to grow? Just add a layer... =&gt; homogenize and scale Maximum span of control for one general supervisor = 500 mi. Direct and indirect reports (supervisors get their own engineers, supply agents, etc.).</p>
<p>Accounting innovation: - Fixed vs. variable costs =&gt; some costs vary with length of road; some costs vary with number of trains - Understanding profitability =&gt; variable pricing - Direct connection between accounting and everyday business tactics/strategic decision-making</p>
<p>Capitalism and exploitation: Chinese immigrants did most construction on railroads; U.S. deported them at close of 19th century when roads were complete.</p>
