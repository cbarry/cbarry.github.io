<p>Another way to think about FCF valuation: a function of revenue growth rate (g), profit margin (p), asset intensity ratio (a), and discount rate.<br>
Tricky part: thinking about asset intensity and profit margin, especially as business model changes.</p>
<p>Asset intensity:<br>
Cash =&gt; separate cash needed to run business (&quot;daily caloric requirement&quot;) from cash lying around (&quot;% body fat).<br>
Asset intensity = [Fixed Assets + Net Operating Working Capital] / Sales<br>
NOWC = (Current Assets + Deferred Receivables -- Cash) -- (Current Liabilities + Deferred Revenues -- Debt)<br>
Basically, combines NWC and fixed assets. Subscription-type business models generally have low or negative asset intensity. Manufacturing has high asset intensity.</p>
<p>Forecasting into the future: as much guesswork as science. Try to tie to expected business realities --- if we have to hire an enterprise sales force and accept a long sales cycle, asset intensity will go up.</p>
<p>To check your math/gain insight into investors' thought process: back out investors' rate of return in likely states of the world. If the firms gets acquired for $200mn in five years, what will rate of return be for Round A investors? This will drive most of their decision-making/preferences.</p>
