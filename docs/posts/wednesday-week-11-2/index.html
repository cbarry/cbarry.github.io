<p>Ventures cut corners on &quot;accredited investor&quot; paperwork in angel rounds. Your investors just have to sign on the dotted line; how are you supposed to know whether they're actually worth over $2M...</p>
<p>Most common &quot;errors&quot; in pro-formas: - Revenue obviously too high in year 4 (or year 5, or whatever). - Profit margin obviously too high in year 4/5 (usually because you didn't think about new hires required when sales picked up, etc.).</p>
<p>Random rules of thumb: - Do quarterly pro-forma P&amp;Ls; month is way too hard to check for mistakes and usually just adds false precision. - Increase salaries by 6-8% per year. - Typical commission on sales: 5%. - Average employee salary: $80-90K plus 15% in benefits. - Sales staff cost $100-200K per year, depending on the industry.</p>
