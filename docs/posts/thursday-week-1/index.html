<p>Incentive systems: formal and informal rules that determine how value creation and destruction are allocated to members of an organization, which affects the amount of value created or destroyed.<br>
Key point: how you divide the pie actually influences the size of the pie.</p>
<p>Two key considerations in designing compensation systems: motivation and selection.</p>
<p>Competing schools of thought on what motivates people &gt;&gt; extrinsic vs. intrinsic.</p>
<p>Extrinsic (Classic economist perspective)<br>
-- $$$ = motivation<br>
-- People mostly look out for themselves</p>
<p>Intrinsic (Dan Pink's &quot;Drive&quot; and lots of experimental research)<br>
-- Autonomy, mastery, purpose<br>
-- Need a base level of extrinsic reward. Above the base level, material rewards actually decrease performance. Ergo, pay people enough so that &quot;money is not an issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Try telling people that you're going to build a business around many smart, educated people working super-hard on something with no obvious material compensation. It sounds stupid.<br>
But: Wikipedia, Apache, Linux, etc.</p>
<p>Atlassian Software = good case study. One free day per quarter to work on whatever; only rule is that you need to share your work the following day. Produced more good ideas and quashed more bugs than organized projects.</p>
<p>Takeaway: When the &quot;profit motive&quot; gets unmoored from the &quot;purpose motive,&quot; bad things happen.<br>
Unethical behavior, poor customer service, trouble recruiting and retaining employees, etc.</p>
