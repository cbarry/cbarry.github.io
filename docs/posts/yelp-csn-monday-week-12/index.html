<p>Yelp: an activity-based dating site masquerading as a portal for local business reviews.</p>
<p>Read elements: photos, variety of opinions, funny, accurate (?)<br>
What does accurate mean? Good for 1s (surfacing terrible places), but lots of 3s and 4s. Self-selection among reviewers: fancy restaurants and greasy spoons get the same review.<br>
Generally, common issues for user-generated content (UGC).</p>
<p>Write elements: Meet product! Yelp Elite community = great way to meet like-minded individuals.<br>
Breadth: open to everyone, but must care about food and write well and have free time</p>
<p>Search: lots of authentic, available data on individual Elites (hard to fake tone in hundreds of reviews), but hard to search and self-selection problems (you must write, too)</p>
<p>Interaction: follow/compliment/forums AND parties! But still hard to interact on Yelp.<br>
Takeaway: Yelp Elite = activity-based dating.</p>
<p>Compare Yelp to TripAdvisor: What does social mean in business terms?<br>
(1) Quality of reviews (positive reviews are more nuanced than on TripAdvisor)<br>
(2) Retention of reviewers (they stay longer and they write more)<br>
(3) Profiles are accurate, reviewers have personal credibility at stake<br>
(4) Breadth of reviews: Elites are incentivized to cover new ground and broaden Yelp's base of reviews</p>
<p>But how the heck do they monetize?<br>
Charging small businesses is hard:<br>
-- High-touch sales to low-dollar-value customers =&gt; bad margins<br>
-- Diminished incentive to advertise for highly-rated businesses: they already look great!<br>
-- Diminished incentive to advertise for low-rated businesses: why drive traffic to a site that makes your restaurant look bad?<br>
-- What does Yelp offer? Better positioning of positive reviews. Does anyone care?</p>
<p>BUT lead generation is a powerful thing for small businesses.<br>
Options: monetize data/analytics, build loyalty platform, serve as mediator between businesses and customers.</p>
<p>Big takeaway: social strategy is NOT the same as digital strategy.<br>
Digital strategy = How do I broadcast my message to people? (classic advertising)<br>
Social strategy = How do I get people to meet/talk to each other, and then do things for my business?</p>
