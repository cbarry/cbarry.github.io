<p>&quot;I believe that, like, Gilt has turned me into an even better multi-tasker than I was before!&quot; - thrilled Gilt customer Gilt has 4M members. Holy moly.</p>
<p>&quot;Michael Bryzek, our CTO and co-founder, was in the warehouse packing boxes for the first few months.&quot; - Alexis Maybank</p>
<p>This is a really complex business model. &quot;72% of our revenues are earned in 90 minutes every day ... All of our customer support calls happen in 90 minutes every day.&quot;</p>
<p>Lots of time pressure, fast throughput, business model could not really exist offline. Need a ton of Kiva robots, tons of data to create &quot;curated&quot; collection specific to the customer, and high enough volume to get decent pricing. &quot;You can't really serve 4M people with leftovers.&quot;</p>
<p>How did Gilt take off? Buy from your suppliers 30 days net; collect from your customers in a little over two weeks. Negative NWC from very early on... Early conversations about Rich vs. King; not framed in exactly that way. But founders quickly hired a CEO and COO to run Gilt when it started blowing up.</p>
