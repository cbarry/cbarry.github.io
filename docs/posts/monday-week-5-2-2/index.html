<p>Ad networks are fabulous businesses at very large scale if you get there first.<br>
Otherwise...</p>
<p>Three-way network: need to balance attention to advertisers, publishers, and game developers.<br>
Really, really hard...</p>
<p>&quot;Alignment&quot;<br>
Mochi probably shouldn't have taken funding from big-fund VCs (Accel). How can this model scale? Did they really want it to?<br>
It doesn't seem like it.<br>
Obviously, it's hard to turn down big-name venture investors...</p>
<p>It's dangerous to scale before you've nailed the business model.<br>
==&gt; End up investing heavily in functions that you later decide you don't need.<br>
==&gt; Mess up culture.<br>
==&gt; Make it very hard to change course.</p>
<p><em>Bonus: Thoughts from Jeff Bussgang (or, &quot;thoughts on Lean Startups from the king of the fat start-up&quot;)</em><br>
-- Winning the market is the goal. Lean Startup is just a methodology. There are no bonus points for &quot;running lean.&quot;<br>
-- There are some situations where fat makes a lot of sense =&gt; cash is a weapon in tough times, raising money is easier when you don't need it, aiming high is how you build a great company.</p>
<p>CONFIDENCE INSPIRES CAPITAL, CAPITAL INSPIRES CONFIDENCE.<br>
When you raise a big round, people start believing in the venture. You can attract great people, you can woo big-name partners, etc. =&gt; virtuous cycle =&gt; &quot;Dance of the Dreamweaver&quot;</p>
