<p>The Sales Funnel <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1yqjI-LoGn8/TItsUTdCIEI/AAAAAAAAAAU/yVgvlclOLG4/s320/1.+Sales+funnel" alt=""></p>
<p>How to generate high-quality leads: no formula; try multiple avenues and measure success.</p>
<p>The purpose of marketing is to drive leads to your sales force. You can spend a lot of marketing money foolishly if you are not disciplined. Do not confuse activity with progress. Orient marketing towards finding &quot;early majority&quot; (in Crossing the Chasm-speak). Otherwise, you'll need a dramatic shift later on.</p>
<p>Good book: &quot;Inbound Marketing,&quot; Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah (HubSpot guys).</p>
<p>The HubSpot thesis: the way people shop and learn about products has changed dramatically. New &quot;smarketing&quot; process: (1) Get found =&gt; create remarkable content; build a website, blog, useful tools, media coverage; start EARLY (2) Convert and personalize. (3) Close.</p>
<p>Your company should form its own persona!</p>
<p>On buying PPC keywords: figure out how your customers describe the problem (&quot;red bumps on my legs&quot;), not how you describe the problem (&quot;erythema nodosum&quot;).</p>
<p>Getting sales structure right is critical <img src="images/image10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Some products are almost un-sellable. Pitching something with $3K of value to dentists = the Valley of Death. Too complex/pricey for no-touch sales model; too cheap for high-touch sales force. Solutions: partner with someone else who already sells to that customer; still hard to do.</p>
