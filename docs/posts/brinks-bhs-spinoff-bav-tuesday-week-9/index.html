      <h1>Brinks / BHS Spinoff (BAV, Tuesday, Week 9)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-03-27">27 Mar 2012</time><a href="/tags/business-analysis-and-valuation/" class="post-tag">business-analysis-and-valuation</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>What kind of companies attract activist investors:<br>
-- Mismanaged =&gt; get on board, influence/replace management<br>
-- Conglomerates =&gt; Valued at less than the sum of its parts<br>
-- &quot;Unlock&quot; value on B/S (ex. real estate) =&gt; undervaluation/suboptimal capital structure; short vs. long-term<br>
-- Ownership structure =&gt; Easy to seize control/accumulate a position</p>
<p>Is Brinks undervalued? Probably.<br>
Yes: room to take on debt, market leader, etc.<br>
No: not feasible to &quot;unlock.&quot;</p>
<p>Leveraged Recap?<br>
Take on debt, pay cash to shareholders/repurchase, gain Interest Tax Shield.</p>
<p>Spinoff?<br>
Good idea: Brand will not be important to BHS, firm is more attractive to a strategic buyer in two parts.<br>
Bad idea: Lose synergies (overhead, cross-selling, risk mgmt), BHS is barely cashflow positive, can't really license brand in this industry.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it is not clear that there was any benefit to spinning off Brinks and BHS...<br>
Rebranding was costly; BHS portion was eventually bought by Tyco.<br>
Combined equity value of Brinks and BHS had been basically flat since spinoff; S&amp;P 500 increased 19%.</p>
