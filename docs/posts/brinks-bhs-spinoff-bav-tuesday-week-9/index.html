      <h1>Brinks / BHS Spinoff (BAV, Tuesday, Week 9)</h1>

<p>What kind of companies attract activist investors: - Mismanaged =&gt; get on board, influence/replace management - Conglomerates =&gt; Valued at less than the sum of its parts - &quot;Unlock&quot; value on B/S (ex. real estate) =&gt; undervaluation/suboptimal capital structure; short vs. long-term - Ownership structure =&gt; Easy to seize control/accumulate a position</p>
<p>Is Brinks undervalued? Probably. Yes: room to take on debt, market leader, etc. No: not feasible to &quot;unlock.&quot;</p>
<p>Leveraged Recap? Take on debt, pay cash to shareholders/repurchase, gain Interest Tax Shield.</p>
<p>Spinoff? Good idea: Brand will not be important to BHS, firm is more attractive to a strategic buyer in two parts. Bad idea: Lose synergies (overhead, cross-selling, risk mgmt), BHS is barely cashflow positive, can't really license brand in this industry.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it is not clear that there was any benefit to spinning off Brinks and BHS... Rebranding was costly; BHS portion was eventually bought by Tyco. Combined equity value of Brinks and BHS had been basically flat since spinoff; S&amp;P 500 increased 19%.</p>
