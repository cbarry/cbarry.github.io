<p>Was Aardvark a &quot;lean startup?&quot; Yes: hypothesis-driven, frequent smoke tests, high frequency of release, lots of prototyping (Mechanical Turk) No: prioritized user acquisition, NOT hypothesis-driven (vision/persistence vs. arrogance/refusal to take feedback?)</p>
<p>Is Aardvark really viral? NO! - Not a game. - Not clear social value for users to share (no ego gain, like Quora or Klout) - No inherent incentives to share. - No social extensions/integration with social platforms.</p>
<p>Perennial lean startup challenge: - Founders pick a business model they like. - Hypothesis testing: Hard to differentiate between legitimate affirmation and false positives. - Hard to keep testing core &quot;big assumptions&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Talent hits a target no one else can hit; genius hits a target no one else can see.&quot; - Schopenhauer (via Jeff Bussgang)</p>
<p>Jon Chim on Aardvark: - &quot;Startups live hand to mouth.&quot; =&gt; Can't possibly test everything; stage investment accordingly - Aardvark spent 30-40% of engineering effort on enabling A/B testing and metric collection =&gt; You need to design everything around making tests possible</p>
<p>- Testing: &quot;We would get four users every week off the street (via Craigslist post). We had users before we knew what we were even testing.&quot;</p>
<p>- Hired engineers who didn't know how to code. =&gt; It causes trouble when you look at a problem and start thinking, &quot;I know how to solve this...&quot; and then immediately start building.</p>
<p>- It's hard to separate timing/implementation from the idea in hypothesis-testing. Especially in network-effects businesses... Did your test fail because the idea was bad, or because you didn't market well enough/have enough users for the product to be valuable when you ran the test?</p>
