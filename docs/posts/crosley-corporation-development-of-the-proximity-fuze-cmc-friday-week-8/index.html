<p>U.S. Government asks Crosley Corp. to commercialize the proximity fuze. Should they?</p>
<p>Yes:<br>
-- Government-funded R&amp;D, no risk<br>
-- In line with core competencies<br>
-- Reputation benefits<br>
-- Improve relationship with government =&gt; makes business sense as war approaches<br>
==&gt; Moral responsibility/duty to country? &lt;== No/concerns: - Massive investment in capacity - Tech risk - Relationship w/ gov't =&gt; big, demanding customer<br>
==&gt; Ethics of manufacturing war materials? &lt;== I was not touched by the supposed ethical issues. They're not making Agent Orange... &quot;Business&quot; model: government-driven innovation NDRC (independent non-profit intermediary) =&gt; Divisions =&gt; Sections (labs)<br>
Coordinate R&amp;D with: Universities<br>
Who coordinate manufacturing/assembly with: Private-sector firms</p>
<p>=&gt; Private firms give up some upside<br>
=&gt; Government involvement defrays risk, enables real commitment by private sector<br>
=&gt; Moral imperative/just cause</p>
<p>Consequences:<br>
Fuzes in 1942 = $732<br>
Fuzes in 1945 = $18</p>
<p>Shockingly efficient; incredibly rapid progress from idea to actual product.<br>
Could this work in other industries/sectors? Cleantech?<br>
Our intuition is to say government should leave everything to the private sector. But sometimes other models seem to work very well...</p>
