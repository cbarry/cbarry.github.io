      <h1>Crosley Corporation / Development of the Proximity Fuze (CMC, Friday, Week 8)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-03-23">23 Mar 2012</time><a href="/tags/cmc/" class="post-tag">cmc</a>

<p>U.S. Government asks Crosley Corp. to commercialize the proximity fuze. Should they?</p>
<p>Yes: - Government-funded R&amp;D, no risk - In line with core competencies - Reputation benefits - Improve relationship with government =&gt; makes business sense as war approaches ==&gt; Moral responsibility/duty to country? &lt;==</p>
<p>No/concerns: - Massive investment in capacity - Tech risk - Relationship w/ gov't =&gt; big, demanding customer ==&gt; Ethics of manufacturing war materials? &lt;==</p>
<p>I was not touched by the supposed ethical issues. They're not making Agent Orange...</p>
<p>&quot;Business&quot; model: government-driven innovation NDRC (independent non-profit intermediary) =&gt; Divisions =&gt; Sections (labs) Coordinate R&amp;D with: Universities Who coordinate manufacturing/assembly with: Private-sector firms</p>
<p>=&gt; Private firms give up some upside =&gt; Government involvement defrays risk, enables real commitment by private sector =&gt; Moral imperative/just cause</p>
<p>Consequences: Fuzes in 1942 = $732 Fuzes in 1945 = $18</p>
<p>Shockingly efficient; incredibly rapid progress from idea to actual product. Could this work in other industries/sectors? Cleantech? Our intuition is to say government should leave everything to the private sector. But sometimes other models seem to work very well...</p>
