<p>Analyzing disruptive business models is graphing margin (y-axis) over time (x-axis) by customer segment/market (z-axis). Usually margin is related to quality or level of service -- in the steel industry, y-axis should be quality of steel. In the medical imaging industry, y-axis should be clarity of image. But going up the y-axis means increasing margin. Good example (courtesy of HBR): <img src="images/chart_2270.gif" alt="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/images/chart_2270.gif"></p>
<p>Ideally, incumbents can spin out disruptive innovations in separate business units. There are still huge headaches -- it's hard to run an organization containing two separate salesforces that sometimes steal customers from each other. Example: EMC (high-end product) and Data General (low-end product) merger. Solution: Find someone else with worse margins to sell one of your products. EMC licensed Dell to sell their low-end product. Dell was thrilled to be hawking low-end IT infrastructure products (which have much better margins than their core PC business). Removes salesforce conflict.</p>
