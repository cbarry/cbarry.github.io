      <h1>The Wright Brothers and Their Flying Machines (CMC, Thursday, Week 6)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-03-01">01 Mar 2012</time><a href="/tags/coming-of-managerial-capitalism/" class="post-tag">coming-of-managerial-capitalism</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>Big problems the Wright Brothers solved</p>
<p>Power supply =&gt; internal combustion engine, custom-built by them<br>
Propulsion =&gt; propellor, custom-built by them, derived from maritime turbine experiments<br>
Stability =&gt; invented control system (wing warping)<br>
Air frame =&gt; experimentally determined lift coefficients via self-built wind-tunnel, custom-built by them<br>
Safety =&gt; many early flight pioneers killed</p>
<p>Incremental or radical innovation?<br>
Not clear that powered flight was even possible; less clear that it would ever be profitable...</p>
<p>Motivations/methodology<br>
-- Started with collaborative, &quot;open source&quot; model of discovery =&gt; built on work by many others<br>
-- Professed interest in science =&gt; despite danger and lack of reward<br>
-- Self-propelled QUEST<br>
-- Did not participate in public contests. Why? Maybe shunned public glory, maybe fear of failure, maybe secrecy/patent protection...</p>
<p>Role of Chanute: visionary/supporter/catalyst OR ineffectual cheerleader?</p>
<p>Parsing their decision to patent --- in spite of &quot;gentlemen's agreement&quot; to share findings with the world<br>
Reasons:<br>
-- Take credit for invention<br>
-- Value =&gt; commercialize, spur competition<br>
-- Reward for execution and risk-taking<br>
-- Fund healthy innovation</p>
<p>But (maybe) abusive:<br>
-- Takes rents from ALL flying machines =&gt; American production of aircraft severely limited until government basically buys the Wright brothers out<br>
-- Makes everyone take out patents --- probably not all patents are meaningful</p>
