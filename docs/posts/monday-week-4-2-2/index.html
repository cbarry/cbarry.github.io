<p>Systematic and focused hypothesis testing at the outset:<br>
-- Will women rent?<br>
-- Will women rent without seeing dresses?<br>
-- Will women damage dresses?<br>
BUT equally important &quot;customer interview&quot; type function ==&gt;&gt; early tests give founders insight into how customers are using product: aspirational purchase; selling &quot;Cinderella for a night&quot;<br>
-- RTR raised seed money BEFORE several key tests. Was this actually a Lean startup? In hindsight, it worked out swimmingly...</p>
<p>Jenn/Jenny thoughts:<br>
-- New customer behavior = challenging. People need reassurance and &quot;social proof&quot; before they do new things.<br>
==&gt;&gt; RTR customers need 7 or 8 &quot;touchpoints&quot;/interactions with with the brand to feel comfortable with the model. Recommendation from a friend, advertising, news stories, etc.<br>
-- RTR is primarily a marketing company. Renting is not inherently cool --- RTR needs to feel like renting a Ferrari, not renting a Chevy. Virality depends on customer's willingness to talk about renting her dress from RTR.<br>
-- Products as marketing =&gt; Drop an extra $1.5K handbag in the shipping box with a dress rental: customer shows off bag and talks about experience, drive virality.</p>
