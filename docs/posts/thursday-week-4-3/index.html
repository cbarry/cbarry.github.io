<p>Technology transfer from universities: be very careful that you are getting terms that make sense for your firm. Patent licenses with a lot of fixed fees attached make sense for large pharma companies, but are the kiss of death for small biotech firms.</p>
<p>Founders agreements are useful for articulating expectations between founders and outlining early-stage plans, but will be nullified/re-negotiated as soon as your firm gets a first round of funding.</p>
<p>&quot;The longer an executive negotiates his employment agreement, the shorter his tenure at a company.&quot; -- Lawyer-guest in EF<br>
Don't spend a ton of time entrenching yourself in an enterprise; it is counterproductive.</p>
<p>Lens to think about deals =&gt; How will this impact your future ability to:<br>
-- Raise money<br>
-- Conduct an IPO<br>
-- Get purchased by a strategic buyer</p>
<p>Incorporate early. Don't be too loose with equity.<br>
If you wait to distribute equity until your firm is ready to receive funding, equity distribution will have painful personal tax implications. Give out equity early while it is cheap.<br>
Don't set aside massive option pools. Pools count as outstanding shares, and basically decrease a firm's pre-money valuation from management's perspective. You can always figure out how to increase the size of an option pool when you want to hire someone useful.</p>
