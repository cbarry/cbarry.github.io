<p>What does Amex do?</p>
<p>Card issue: - Aspirational/premium image (fees), higher spending per cardholder than competitors - Direct to consumer (no issuers) = CONTROL, &quot;closed loop&quot; but CAC is higher than competitors ($250+)</p>
<p>Transaction processing: - Charge higher fees to merchants - First-mover into value-add services: travel planning, concierge =&gt; consumer perception of safety but limited availability of merchants</p>
<p>Funding liabilities: - 8% loss provisions (disputed charges; non-payment)</p>
<p>And then they start getting into social... <a href="http://colinbarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/amex2x2.jpg"><img src="images/amex2x2-1024x765.jpg" alt="" title="amex2x2"></a></p>
<p>Strengths of AmEx execution: - Willingness to experiment. - Evolve from mediocre initiatives (Members Project) to stuff that drives business results (Social Rewards Program). Develops in-house social proficiency; solves the &quot;Legal needs three days to review every tweet&quot; problems; continuous improvement. - Because CAC is ordinarily so high, lots of potential in social/network effects pay off handsomely. - Capitalizes on existing AmEx positioning/overall strategy (trustworthiness of brand means that consumers are more likely to link credit card to FourSquare account; premium image means that consumers are more likely to brag about AmEx deals/share with friends). - Ends up with AmEx thinking about their core business differently (potential to drive traffic to retailers; loosely competitive with Groupon/LivingSocial).</p>
<p>Challenges: - Still a big company. - Change takes time.</p>
<p>Takeaways: (1) Usually, everybody's social strategy starts with taking your initial product and sprinkling in badly-designed social elements (make a Facebook page). Need to evolve from there. (2) Usually, there is some element of trade-off between fixing social failures and effectively monetizing. It's hard to find programs that (1) make a boatload of money and (2) offer awesome social solutions.</p>
