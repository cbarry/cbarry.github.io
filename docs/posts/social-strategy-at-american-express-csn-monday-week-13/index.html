<p>What does Amex do?</p>
<p>Card issue:<br>
-- Aspirational/premium image (fees), higher spending per cardholder than competitors<br>
-- Direct to consumer (no issuers) = CONTROL, &quot;closed loop&quot;<br>
but CAC is higher than competitors ($250+)</p>
<p>Transaction processing:<br>
-- Charge higher fees to merchants<br>
-- First-mover into value-add services: travel planning, concierge =&gt; consumer perception of safety<br>
but limited availability of merchants</p>
<p>Funding liabilities:<br>
-- 8% loss provisions (disputed charges; non-payment)</p>
<p>And then they start getting into social...<br>

<p>Strengths of AmEx execution:<br>
-- Willingness to experiment.<br>
-- Evolve from mediocre initiatives (Members Project) to stuff that drives business results (Social Rewards Program). Develops in-house social proficiency; solves the &quot;Legal needs three days to review every tweet&quot; problems; continuous improvement.<br>
-- Because CAC is ordinarily so high, lots of potential in social/network effects pay off handsomely.<br>
-- Capitalizes on existing AmEx positioning/overall strategy (trustworthiness of brand means that consumers are more likely to link credit card to FourSquare account; premium image means that consumers are more likely to brag about AmEx deals/share with friends).<br>
-- Ends up with AmEx thinking about their core business differently (potential to drive traffic to retailers; loosely competitive with Groupon/LivingSocial).</p>
<p>Challenges:<br>
-- Still a big company.<br>
-- Change takes time.</p>
<p>Takeaways:<br>
(1) Usually, everybody's social strategy starts with taking your initial product and sprinkling in badly-designed social elements (make a Facebook page). Need to evolve from there.<br>
(2) Usually, there is some element of trade-off between fixing social failures and effectively monetizing. It's hard to find programs that (1) make a boatload of money and (2) offer awesome social solutions.</p>
