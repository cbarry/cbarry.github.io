      <h1>New Carolina Initiative (MOC, Tuesday, Week 12)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-04-17">17 Apr 2012</time><a href="/tags/microeconomics-of-competitiveness/" class="post-tag">microeconomics-of-competitiveness</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>Why has South Carolina stayed poor?<br>
-- Agricultural history<br>
-- Losing jobs in textiles and apparel<br>
-- Bad educational/human capital base</p>
<p>Traditional South Carolina growth strategy:<br>
-- &quot;pro-business&quot; environment<br>
-- cheap labor<br>
-- recruit big manufacturing firms with tax incentives<br>
-- emphasize technical education</p>
<p>Why this doesn't work:<br>
-- Subsidies are costly. State tax rate is significantly higher than national average (17.7% vs. 15%); tax incentives to big firms get paid for by local businesses/citizens.<br>
-- Attract the wrong kind of firms: sensitive to labor costs = won't invest in human development<br>
-- Doesn't address roads, schools, other fundamentals<br>
-- There is always someone cheaper (globally)<br>
Overall, focus on individual companies, not state competitiveness.</p>
<p>So why did South Carolina do this?<br>
-- Diversify away from dying industries<br>
-- Jobs = politicians' success metric<br>
-- Tax incentives are not as visible to constituency as infrastructure spending<br>
-- SHORT TERM VICTORIES = what politicians love</p>
<p>So how well as the New Carolina Initiative performed?<br>
Positives: some cluster organization, some state agency involvement, education/training metrics improved, foundation laid (?).<br>
Negatives: still low per-capita income, still bad education, senior government leaders are uninvolved/skeptical, textiles are still bleeding.<br>
Complicated by '08 recession, and only really six or seven years old...</p>
