      <h1>New Carolina Initiative (MOC, Tuesday, Week 12)</h1>

<p>Why has South Carolina stayed poor? - Agricultural history - Losing jobs in textiles and apparel - Bad educational/human capital base</p>
<p>Traditional South Carolina growth strategy: - &quot;pro-business&quot; environment - cheap labor - recruit big manufacturing firms with tax incentives - emphasize technical education</p>
<p>Why this doesn't work: - Subsidies are costly. State tax rate is significantly higher than national average (17.7% vs. 15%); tax incentives to big firms get paid for by local businesses/citizens. - Attract the wrong kind of firms: sensitive to labor costs = won't invest in human development - Doesn't address roads, schools, other fundamentals - There is always someone cheaper (globally) Overall, focus on individual companies, not state competitiveness.</p>
<p>So why did South Carolina do this? - Diversify away from dying industries - Jobs = politicians' success metric - Tax incentives are not as visible to constituency as infrastructure spending - SHORT TERM VICTORIES = what politicians love</p>
<p>So how well as the New Carolina Initiative performed? Positives: some cluster organization, some state agency involvement, education/training metrics improved, foundation laid (?). Negatives: still low per-capita income, still bad education, senior government leaders are uninvolved/skeptical, textiles are still bleeding. Complicated by '08 recession, and only really six or seven years old...</p>
