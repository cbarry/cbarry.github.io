<p>The Louisiana Purchase: possibly the best real estate deal in the history of the world $10M for New Orleans + $5M for Louisiana Territory + ~$7M for extras = $22M ($450M in today's dollars)</p>
<p>How did Astor go from penniless to the tycoon of his era? - Organized; great talent manager (equity compensation for employees; management techniques that were hundreds of years ahead of his time) - Capital at a time when it was scarce - Close connection to U.S. government - &quot;World without rules&quot; (climate of the time)</p>
<p>Fur =&gt; merchant trading =&gt; real estate/infrastructure Consistent radical innovation that changed industry structure: built monopolies and then destroyed monopolies. See also: Schumpeter on creative destruction</p>
<p>Throughout his life, Astor's workday ended at 2pm. His net worth grew at about 50% CAGR for 48 years. What have you done lately, and how hard are you working?</p>
<p>Managing merchant ships on four-year voyages: - Get the best captains in the world - Give captains a stake in the venture - Give captains some guidance; trust their decision-making - Make sure captains have a wife and kids at home (so they don't run away with your merchandise)</p>
