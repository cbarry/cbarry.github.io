<p>The Louisiana Purchase: possibly the best real estate deal in the history of the world<br>
$10M for New Orleans + $5M for Louisiana Territory + ~$7M for extras = $22M ($450M in today's dollars)</p>
<p>How did Astor go from penniless to the tycoon of his era?<br>
-- Organized; great talent manager (equity compensation for employees; management techniques that were hundreds of years ahead of his time)<br>
-- Capital at a time when it was scarce<br>
-- Close connection to U.S. government<br>
-- &quot;World without rules&quot; (climate of the time)</p>
<p>Fur =&gt; merchant trading =&gt; real estate/infrastructure<br>
Consistent radical innovation that changed industry structure: built monopolies and then destroyed monopolies.<br>

<p>Throughout his life, Astor's workday ended at 2pm. His net worth grew at about 50% CAGR for 48 years. What have you done lately, and how hard are you working?</p>
<p>Managing merchant ships on four-year voyages:<br>
-- Get the best captains in the world<br>
-- Give captains a stake in the venture<br>
-- Give captains some guidance; trust their decision-making<br>
-- Make sure captains have a wife and kids at home (so they don't run away with your merchandise)</p>
