      <h1>Morgan Stanley Risk-Reward Framework / Valuation in Practice (BAV, Tuesday, Week 11)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-04-10">10 Apr 2012</time><a href="/tags/business-analysis-and-valuation/" class="post-tag">business-analysis-and-valuation</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>Morgan Stanley moves to a more-nuanced standard for analyst reports. Good idea?</p>
<p>Positives:<br>
-- Sketching out bull/bear/base cases =&gt; forces a more fundamentals-based approach<br>
-- Explicitly surfaces critical uncertainties<br>
-- Greater transparency, CYA<br>
-- Forces analysts to question assumptions and consider the downside<br>
-- Provokes conversation, accommodates customer heterogeneity<br>
*** Enables analysts to lay out a bear case without alienating company and destroying future access to management</p>
<p>Negatives:<br>
-- Is this really innovative? Everyone does this...<br>
-- No clear decision/recommendation, lack of commitment<br>
-- Too much transparency? Some of these reports are bad...<br>
-- False sense of certainty<br>
-- Pressure on top analysts to change; may drive them away</p>
<p>What makes a good sell-side research analyst? What do analysts do?<br>
-- Industry knowledge<br>
-- Access to company management<br>
-- Stock-picking ability<br>
Premium for all-star analysts =&gt; Institutional Investor grading</p>
<p>Still room for improvement:<br>
-- Can simplify probability inferences and/or report options market's inferred probability of each scenario<br>
-- Could give some flexibility to &quot;top&quot; analysts =&gt; one-size-fits-all isn't always correct</p>
<p>General thoughts<br>
Risk-reward framework enables better justification of negative reports, may be more informative, and lowers the probability of &quot;herding&quot; in analyst assessments.<br>
But there are limits to one-size-fits-all, and it's harder to do quality control on complex reports.<br>
Maybe this is not that innovative, maybe it should be easy to copy. But research reports had not changed in decades...</p>
