<p>How big was the dot-com bubble? August 1995 (day before Netscape IPO) -- NASDAQ at 1,005 March 2000 (peak of the bubble) -- NASDAQ at 5,132 Yesterday -- NASDAQ at 3,068</p>
<p>Is <a href="http://Pets.com">Pets.com</a> a good opportunity? - Category killer (race to get scale, realize economies) - High gross margin, low net margin because bricks-and-mortar is costly - Recurring revenue &gt;&gt; Rewards to first mover (theoretically); winner-take-all &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Is this really a winner-take-all business? Maybe -- see also, Amazon.</p>
<p>Concerns: Competitive dynamics (destructive rivalry between <a href="http://petstore.com">petstore.com</a> and <a href="http://pets.com">pets.com</a>) Do consumers need to see/touch pet food and supplies? Margin / weight (Commentary: I did not find this implausible) Network effects? Loyalty? (Commentary: I did not find this implausible)</p>
<p>Lots of grousing about specific assumptions in the business plan. (Commentary: Totally misses the point -- basic thesis in early-stage venture is that a smart team with a plausible business model and a big market will figure out how to win. At the beginning, <a href="http://Pets.com">Pets.com</a> team made a reasonably compelling case that CAC Macro perspective: Tons of value evaporated when dot-com bubble exploded. Maybe. Huge benefit to society in reducing the cost of IT and e-commerce. Lots of busts, several huge wins. (Commentary: Not even that many busts -- the case posits that around 60% of bubble-era startups failed, which is much lower than the 90% failure rate that people expect for tech startups today.).</p>
