<p>I am a poor judge of social need.</p>
<p>People don't have many close friends.<br>
-- Survey in 2004: 25% of Americans do not have someone they can talk to about serious personal issues (close friend).<br>
-- Trend over past 25 years or so: more people are good friends with their spouse, fewer people have friends other than their spouse.<br>
-- Best predictor of your number of close friends: years of education.<br>
==&gt; Corollary: Well-educated, high-income people often have bad personal intuition about the value proposition of social media. Because they already have friends...<br>
==&gt; Other corollary: Minorities (racial, ethnic, sexual, etc.) are some of the heaviest users of social media. People prefer to associate with others like them (homophily); this often shuts minorities out.</p>
<p>Old people are alone a lot. Call your grandma.<br>
-- Average 70-year-old: 185 days a year with no interaction with a close friend.</p>
<p>Sparse networks of friends vs. dense networks<br>
Sparse: better ideas (less groupthink), correlated with income/promotion/success in men. NOT correlated with career success in women (usually need a dense network with a strategic partner/mentor).<br>
Dense: friends take better care of you.</p>
<p>Great predictor of success in long-term romantic relationships: degree of integration of your social network with your spouse. (Comment: Maybe just increases the &quot;cost&quot; of divorce, keeps marriages together longer than they should last...).</p>
<p>Biggest unmet social needs:<br>
-- Close relationships, esp with family (you can't pick your relatives)<br>
==&gt; Facebook is NOT designed for 70-year-olds.<br>
-- Distance<br>
-- Un-intrusive, easy-to-use technology</p>
