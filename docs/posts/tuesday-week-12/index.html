<p>Vital Amines (or, &quot;what's still missing if we understand disruption&quot;)<br>
-- Where is &quot;the edge of the earth?&quot; Probably there is some limit to the level of innovation a company should pursue. Where does it lie? What types of innovations will actually never work for me/my company?<br>
Example: Should Intel NBI have created <a href="http://salesforce.com">salesforce.com</a> or NetFlix? Probably not.</p>
<p>-- Why do some firms with &quot;disruptive potential&quot; beat out others?<br>
Example: There were hundreds of Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers in the late 80s/early 90s. There are currently three with 90-something percent market share --- Asustek, Acer, and HTC. What did they do different?<br>
One thought: &quot;deep dives&quot; =&gt; CEOs and key managers spent 5% of time on existing businesses and 70% on new businesses. If you have good processes for sustaining core business, best people should not focus on the core business. You need them to develop new processes for new businesses...</p>
<p>-- What the heck do you do if you're a smart low-level employee at a firm that is messing up?<br>
I.e. You're a junior guy at Intel and you see ARM/mobile on the horizon. You know it's going to kill Intel in 10 years if you don't do anything. What can you really do?<br>
My Answer: Leave Intel, start a business around ARM...<br>
Ironic, because the class is called &quot;Building and Sustaining Successful Enterprises.&quot;</p>
