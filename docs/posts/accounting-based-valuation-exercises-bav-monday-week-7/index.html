<p>The Abnormal Earnings Model = one (sort of weird; non-traditional) way to value firms<br>
<a href="../../img/equity-abnormal-earnings-equation.png"><img src="../../img/equity-abnormal-earnings-equation-300x97.png" alt="" title="equity-abnormal-earnings-equation"></a><br>
-- Should be &quot;the same&quot; as dividend discounting or DCF<br>
-- Maybe better because provides better theory/economics behind price multiples<br>
-- Implementation: less messy than other methods<br>
=====&gt; terminal value is usually a huge component of DCF; not that much better than just using multiples<br>
=====&gt; book value (as a minimum value of future cash flows) captures most of what would be terminal value</p>
<p>Using accounting-based valuation<br>
-- Price / Earnings =&gt; measures what investors will pay for a dollar of earnings today (driven by growth prospects)<br>
-- Price / Book Value =&gt; measures (backward-looking) ability to generate sustainable, high ROE =&gt; driven by both earnings growth and ROE (firm must be profitable)<br>
-- Higher ROE today means lower P/E, all else being equal ===&gt; turnarounds typically have high P/E ratio: low earnings today compared to what they &quot;should&quot; be<br>
-- High leverage usually means high cost-of-equity (r) =&gt; increased possibility of financial distress</p>
