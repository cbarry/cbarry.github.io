<p>How the heck can Facebook monetize?</p>
<p>Display Ads --- mediocre results<br>
Why ads don't work well on social platforms:<br>
-- Wrong context (salesman pulls up a chair at your family dinner table)<br>
-- Harms user experience<br>
-- No purchasing intent (vs. search engine, which have &gt;2% CTR)</p>
<p>Targeted ads (age/geography/education/gender/religion/interests) --- somewhat better results</p>
<p>Friend-approved, brand-generated content --- great<br>
The real goldmine: the &quot;Like&quot; button<br>
===&gt; Friend-posted ads = 10x higher CTR. Why? surprise, relevance, FEAR OF MISSING OUT<br>
And your friend endorsed it --- doesn't look like advertising!<br>
But why do people tolerate --- and even welcome --- app-generated content?<br>
===&gt; People want content. And people hate writing --- ~25% of active Facebook users have blank profiles.</p>
<p>Brand pages --- mixed bag<br>
As a one-way channel to communicate with fans --- maybe good<br>
===&gt; Cheap way to talk to users and share content, BUT preaching to the converted (users already opted in)<br>
Upside: shareable stories; maybe good content goes viral and builds awareness with friends<br>
As a channel for fans to communicate with brand and with each other --- not so great<br>
Upside: feedback on customer experience<br>
Downside: probably not good feedback (people tend to post complaints), brands forfeit control over their image (can't really moderate/curate your brand page; it's creepy)</p>
<p>Facebook Platform (access to everything but users' &quot;read&quot; history; capability to post to profile) --- jackpot<br>
Examples: FarmVille posts to my profile when I play, horoscope app posts to my profile every day with zero input from me, EventBrite posts ticket purchases on my profile.<br>
EventBrite: I buy a Lady Gaga ticket. EventBrite posts to my profile --- free advertising for Lady Gaga, social proof of event's awesomeness! Very high CTR! My friend buys a ticket, and the cycle repeats itself.<br>
Is there really any better advertising than &quot;your friend bought this&quot;?<br>
EventBrite says the average write-back is worth $2.50 !!!</p>
<p>Takeaways: the best social strategies solve users' social failures.<br>
People hate generating content. Do it for them...</p>
