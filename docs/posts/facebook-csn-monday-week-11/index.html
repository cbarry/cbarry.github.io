<p>How the heck can Facebook monetize?</p>
<p>Display Ads -- mediocre results Why ads don't work well on social platforms: - Wrong context (salesman pulls up a chair at your family dinner table) - Harms user experience - No purchasing intent (vs. search engine, which have &gt;2% CTR)</p>
<p>Targeted ads (age/geography/education/gender/religion/interests) -- somewhat better results</p>
<p>Friend-approved, brand-generated content -- great The real goldmine: the &quot;Like&quot; button ===&gt; Friend-posted ads = 10x higher CTR. Why? surprise, relevance, FEAR OF MISSING OUT And your friend endorsed it -- doesn't look like advertising! But why do people tolerate -- and even welcome -- app-generated content? ===&gt; People want content. And people hate writing -- ~25% of active Facebook users have blank profiles.</p>
<p>Brand pages -- mixed bag As a one-way channel to communicate with fans -- maybe good ===&gt; Cheap way to talk to users and share content, BUT preaching to the converted (users already opted in) Upside: shareable stories; maybe good content goes viral and builds awareness with friends As a channel for fans to communicate with brand and with each other -- not so great Upside: feedback on customer experience Downside: probably not good feedback (people tend to post complaints), brands forfeit control over their image (can't really moderate/curate your brand page; it's creepy)</p>
<p>Facebook Platform (access to everything but users' &quot;read&quot; history; capability to post to profile) -- jackpot Examples: FarmVille posts to my profile when I play, horoscope app posts to my profile every day with zero input from me, EventBrite posts ticket purchases on my profile. EventBrite: I buy a Lady Gaga ticket. EventBrite posts to my profile -- free advertising for Lady Gaga, social proof of event's awesomeness! Very high CTR! My friend buys a ticket, and the cycle repeats itself. Is there really any better advertising than &quot;your friend bought this&quot;? EventBrite says the average write-back is worth $2.50 !!!</p>
<p>Takeaways: the best social strategies solve users' social failures. People hate generating content. Do it for them...</p>
