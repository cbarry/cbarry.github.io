<p>&quot;Competition sucks.&quot; -- Seth Klarman, Baupost Group</p>
<p>Hunch-driven vs. data-driven entrepreneurs: Fred Wilson funds both.<br>
Caveat: hunch-driven entrepreneurs usually have a lot of domain experience ==&gt; entrepreneur's hunch usually comes from an &quot;obsessive-compulsive desire to solve a problem his own life&quot;</p>
<p>Failure is usually more instructive than success.<br>
&quot;We've made more money backing entrepreneurs coming off of a failure than backing entrepreneurs coming off of a success.&quot; -- Fred Wilson</p>
<p>Virality is not always possible: needs to be some incentive for the user to get others onto the product.<br>
(Comment: I don't think this is true. Hotmail virality was based on footer addendum to all e-mail messages [&quot;This message was sent with Hotmail --- free web-based email&quot; with a hyperlink].)</p>
<p>When to monetize: early vs. late<br>
Monetize early if (1) it makes the user experience better or (2) you have a concrete, well-defined idea about how to monetize.<br>
A common fallacy: Twitter took five years to monetize. Similar stories for Google, Facebook, etc.<br>
BUT THEY ARE UNIQUE ANIMALS.<br>
Your startup is not Twitter, and you will probably not be able to wait years and years before attempting to monetize.</p>
<p>Partnerships/startup deals with big companies: mixed bag.<br>
Frequently, big-company deals &quot;take forever&quot; and &quot;suck the life out of a company.&quot;<br>
Find ways to compete with gatekeepers.<br>
How do you compete with HBS? Go right to the customer (students); avoid partnership.</p>
<p>Why Fred Wilson likes angels and VC co-investment:<br>
-- VCs have deep pockets and can scale the company. Angels usually can't help scale.<br>
-- But angels, especially good ones, will go to bat for you no matter what.</p>
<p>MVP in a B2B startup: market demand.<br>
People saying, &quot;This product is a game-changer and I want to have a business relationship with it.&quot;</p>
<p>Question: What kind of startup should you launch?<br>
Answer: I'm not positive, but NOT whatever is super-hot today.<br>
Basic thesis =&gt; Anything that CAN become end-to-end digital, but is not currently digital.<br>
Internet models worked well in media and e-commerce. They will penetrate healthcare, education, financial services, etc.</p>
<p>Passing on Airbnb:<br>
&quot;I got caught up in the air mattress thing, and I couldn't get past it.&quot; -- Fred Wilson<br>
(Comment: I was very impressed by Fred Wilson's personal modesty/reluctance to make the sort of self-aggrandizing, judgmental pronouncements common among a certain sort of venture investors.)</p>
<p>Do something original. &quot;I very much dislike copycats.&quot; -- Fred Wilson</p>
