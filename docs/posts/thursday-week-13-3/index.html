<p>Daniel Kahneman on how you experience life vs. how you remember life:<br>
(1) Duration doesn't matter.<br>
Example: 30-year marriage where the first 27 years were great and then you had 3 years of fights and a messy divorce. You don't actually think about the fact that the good years far outstripped the bad...</p>
<p>(2) It's all about the peaks and the end.<br>
You don't really remember the troughs (tough moments) in hindsight, as long as the highs were high and things ended well.</p>
<p>Collected learnings from the semester (from the class as a whole)<br>
-- See people as they want to be, not just as they are.<br>
-- Find/create LDG-like settings where you can think intentionally about your life. Because you won't get the best insight from your spouse, your parents, your close friends, your co-workers, or your boss.<br>
-- &quot;It's okay to have high-class problems; it's not okay to think they're real problems.&quot;<br>
-- Everyone is uncomfortable about something.<br>
-- &quot;Ask for help when you need it.&quot; Also, in hindsight, ask for help when you don't need it.<br>
-- &quot;If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.&quot; Â -- Woody Allen</p>
