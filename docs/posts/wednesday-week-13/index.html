      <h1>Accretive Health (EF, Wednesday, Week 13)</h1>

<p>What's wrong with healthcare? Herzlinger: Consumers don't have information or incentives to make sensible choices. Porter: Ineffective competition in healthcare does not produce greater consumer surplus. Christensen: Muted incentives and artificial barriers to entry prevent disruptive entrants.</p>
<p>Accretive =&gt; &quot;plump&quot; startup &gt;&gt; Initially, small team of senior execs. Sell Clearview on taking over their revenue cycle; instantly have $100M in revenue. &quot;Don't spend the money to build capabilities; sign the client first. It worked at Accenture. We (Accretive) started with eight people.&quot; - Etienne Deffarges</p>
<p>Other nice things: high touch, no upfront cost to hospitals, hospitals pre-pay = negative OWC. Dual focus on (1) reducing revenue leakage and (2) cutting cost of collections.</p>
<p>Etienne Deffarges: The revenue cycle model is basically a zero-sum game (gains to hospital come at the expense of payors). Not too much opportunity to take cost out of the system.</p>
<p>Basic model for QTCC (building an ACO): Go to the payors, get them to agree to reimburse at 98% of last year's rates. Then, cut cost by 20%. Split the savings between providers, hospital, and Accretive.</p>
<p>More sophisticated model for QTCC: Large incentive payments to PCPs to alter care allocation. Then, hospitals increase number of PCPs (more PCPs per specialist/ER doc.). =&gt; Instead of PCPs spending 15 minutes on every patient, pay more attention to high-risk patients and follow up. Use metrics like hospital readmission. =&gt; Five percent of patients = 50% of healthcare cost. Ten percent of patients = 67% of healthcare cost.</p>
