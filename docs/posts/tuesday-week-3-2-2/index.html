<p>MVP/hypothesis does NOT have to directly contribute to product development. Example: you could test whether 40-55 y/o males will share their investment decisions by running a three-month public portfolio management contest</p>
<p>It's really easy to say &quot;test hypotheses rigorously&quot; and &quot;assume nothing.&quot; It's a lot harder to do in practice, and there are sometimes false positives and false negatives.</p>
<p>PR and snazzy launches: sometimes appropriate, sometimes not.</p>
<p>A good idea doesn't necessarily make a great business. =&gt; Steve's example: renting zoo animals for birthday parties</p>
<p>Biz dev is dead (at least for the consumer web) =&gt; you don't need it to get scale anymore (and if you do, you probably have the wrong idea)</p>
<p>Get the best VC investors you can =&gt; big funds = follow-on investment, smart advisors (caveat: coming from a former EiR at Accel, Steve Carpenter)</p>
<p>Blog/do other things to build personal credibility.</p>
<p>The economics of being a founder at a startup (as opposed to an early hire) are phenomenal. For 6-10 months of additional risk, founder gets tremendous upside.</p>
<p>&quot;I am never going to raise friends and family money again.&quot; - Steve Carpenter</p>
