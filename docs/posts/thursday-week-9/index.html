<p>How do you actually define &quot;high impact entrepreneurship?&quot; After listening to the founder, I'm still not sure...</p>
<p>Selecting Endeavor Entrepreneurs = balance between potential to blow up, economic progress, and social progress Endeavor has basically targeted returns (potential to blow up). Sort of like a VC firm, except they appear to make much safer bets (high % of successful ventures) and only pick 10-20 entrepreneurs per country. So they clearly can't take the same risks as VCs, for whom most bets fail.</p>
<p>Endeavor seems to be doing a lot of good in places where there is no culture of entrepreneurship. And I am impressed. But Brazil was booming before Endeavor -- are they just riding the wave?</p>
<p>I am not sure how I feel about this, or even whether I think Endeavor is achieving something meaningful (versus anointing destined-for-success firms in developing countries and serving as a summer employment option for former consultants in business school who don't land anything &quot;better&quot;). Endeavor summer hires I have met are not that impressive, aside from having resumes including experience at a bulge-bracket bank/big-3 consulting firm. I am a bit skeptical.</p>
