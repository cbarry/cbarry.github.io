<p>Mostly personal takeaways.</p>
<p>-- It is really easy to get lazy about testing assumptions. It's one thing to say that you're Lean, but nobody actually wants to get proven wrong...<br>
-- Expose yourself and your plan to ridicule.<br>
-- Benefits of explaining your business model from a blank sheet of paper =&gt; surfaces implicit assumptions; useful even if you are convinced that your unique insight (ha-ha) is correct.<br>
-- Facts exist outside the building =&gt; I already believed it, but speculating about a business model for two hours makes it so much more obvious.<br>
-- &quot;My hypothesis can't be tested&quot; is always wrong. It might take more creativity than Google AdWords.<br>
But if I wanted to found another me-too e-commerce startup, I wouldn't decorate the walls of my bedroom with Randy Komisar quotations.</p>
