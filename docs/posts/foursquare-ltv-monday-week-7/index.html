<p>Hunch-driven entrepreneurship at its finest...</p>
<p>Why did Foursquare succeed when Dodgeball failed? - Smartphones existed. - Social networks more mature (Facebook, Twitter) =&gt; lower CAC - Splashy PR launch SxSW - More gameification (see also, smartphones) - Launched in NYC =&gt; large, young, tech-savvy market; trend-setters (Commentary: Is this really a Lean startup? Try the same idea after it failed/worked out mediocre the first time; change almost nothing conceptually and don't do much testing/metric-driven development?)</p>
<p>Big takeaway: context and timing make a big difference.</p>
<p>Does Foursquare have Product-Market Fit? (I say yes) Pro: Strong engagement metrics 15M users Passionate users</p>
<p>Anti: CVP is weak/fuzzy Haven't (Can't?) monetize Some product concerns: attrition, engagement, etc.</p>
<p>Hold off on monetization if: Your product has strong network effects =&gt; focus on getting a zillion users AND You can raise cheap capital</p>
<p>Monetization with advertising is very difficult. You need massive scale to matter to advertisers and merchants.</p>
<p>Beware big-company biz dev deals. Big brands think of your startup as a toy: they will drop you in a heartbeat, often with dramatic consequences for the financial and emotional health of your startup...</p>
<p>Jeff Bussgang's Parting Thoughts (1) Entrepreneurship is about passion.</p>
<p>(2) Failure and humility: part of life. &quot;Happiness isn't a goal, it's a byproduct.&quot; - Eleanor Roosevelt</p>
<p>(3) Balance and perspective: hard to maintain, pretty important.</p>
