<p>Eddie Bauer emerges from bankruptcy that stemmed mostly from problems with its parent company. EB has been on a downward slide for 5 years. How much is this thing worth?</p>
<p>Accounting Analysis:<br>
Large chunk of balance sheet is Deferred Tax Asset (arises from NOLs, evaporates if company is sold) and Goodwill (big increase due to recapitalization/bankruptcy).<br>
All real estate is operating leases: might want to make these capital leases...<br>
Substantial reorganization expenses in '04 and '05, probably want to adjust if we use history to forecast future income statements.</p>
<p>&quot;Fresh start&quot; accounting: emerging from bankruptcy, assets and liabilities on balance sheet are adjusted to fair value (same as purchase accounting), mapped onto bankruptcy court's determination of the firm's value.<br>
Impact:<br>
-- Assets that were fully depreciated (think factories) are not anymore. Income statement usually looks worse due to higher depreciation (more expenses). Competing incentives in measuring asset values:<br>
===&gt; Under-report value of assets: boosts future ROA<br>
===&gt; Over-report value of assets: better if owners want to sell soon; restructuring plan needs to be accepted by court/creditors (and that is more likely with more assets).</p>
<p>Financial Analysis:<br>
No-good-very-bad historical performance.<br>
BUT, means aggressive sales growth projections for the near future may be justified. Starting point is really low...</p>
<p>Valuation:<br>
Abnormal earnings method is NOT really built for firms where book value = fair value.<br>
Write-up in book value (goodwill) captures what we would otherwise try to model in a valuation. For Eddie Bauer valuation, almost everything in share price comes from beginning book value.<br>
So if we think that some of the book value got arbitrarily written up (goodwill increase to make A = L + E), we probably want to either just value the firm at book OR do abnormal earnings but adjust for the increase...</p>
