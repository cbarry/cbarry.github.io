<p>Core biz = energy efficiency Key elements of strategy: behavioral science, marketing, Big Data (from utilities)</p>
<p>Assessing impact: more cost-effective than everything but CFL lighting (which everyone hates)</p>

<p>Interesting challenges/misalignments: Engineering =&gt; finite resource, views PM as demanding/unfamiliar with technical challenges/ignorant of codebase Sales =&gt; short-term perspective, driven to over-promise by commission structure, typically in favor of customization, wants everything faster Marketing =&gt; long-term perspective, not as measurable as sales Customers =&gt; utilities? consumers? Say one think, do another; don't always know what they really want. CEO =&gt; natural tendency to micro-manage (especially because he/she was probably product lead at the beginning...)</p>
<p>Token system: Allocate X% of development resources to sales requests to expedite/add new features. Balance need for comprehensive product vision/independent roadmap with need to acquire customers NOW.</p>
<p>Takeaways (from Eric Paley): - Even after good product-market fit, scaling is a really hard problem. - The PM's goal = efficiently satisfying the true customer need, NOT the espoused customer need - PM has limited power; must find ways to build legitimacy and influence outcomes, SO: ==&gt; Develop rules that build trust but enforce tradeoffs ==&gt; Develop rules that reflect the values and strategy of the organization (token allocation: should reflect company's strategy)</p>
<p>Ben Foster's comments: - A real product roadmap (independent of contractual commitments) = critical to building advantage/staying ahead of competitors</p>
<p>- PM's role: &quot;to make the product successful on the market -- period.&quot; Natural tension between developing good processes and necessary scrappiness/improvisation</p>
<p>- Internal marketplace/token system: formalizes tradeoff between sales-driven development and product-driven development If you don't have a long-term product vision, your competitors will leapfrog you...</p>
<p>- Platform strategy: if you don't want to do a ton of customization, figure out how your customers can build on top of your product. Can't say &quot;We don't support this&quot; -- Can say &quot;We solve this in a generic way by making it possible for you to customize/build on top of our product&quot; ==&gt; future-proofing!</p>
<p>- OPOWER's customer is the consumer, not the utility. OPOWER: &quot;Allow us to focus on the consumer on your behalf.&quot; ==&gt; lets firm be a thought-leader rather than totally reactive to individual utility requirements</p>
<p>- Technical debt is a hard problem.</p>
