      <h1>OPOWER / Product Management (LTV, Monday, Week 6)</h1>

<p>Core biz = energy efficiency<br>
Key elements of strategy: behavioral science, marketing, Big Data (from utilities)</p>
<p>Assessing impact: more cost-effective than everything but CFL lighting (which everyone hates)</p>
<p><a href="../../img/OPOWER.jpg"><img src="../../img/OPOWER-1024x683.jpg" alt="" title="OPOWER"></a></p>
<p>Interesting challenges/misalignments:<br>
Engineering =&gt; finite resource, views PM as demanding/unfamiliar with technical challenges/ignorant of codebase<br>
Sales =&gt; short-term perspective, driven to over-promise by commission structure, typically in favor of customization, wants everything faster<br>
Marketing =&gt; long-term perspective, not as measurable as sales<br>
Customers =&gt; utilities? consumers? Say one think, do another; don't always know what they really want.<br>
CEO =&gt; natural tendency to micro-manage (especially because he/she was probably product lead at the beginning...)</p>
<p>Token system:<br>
Allocate X% of development resources to sales requests to expedite/add new features.<br>
Balance need for comprehensive product vision/independent roadmap with need to acquire customers NOW.</p>
<p>Takeaways (from Eric Paley):<br>
-- Even after good product-market fit, scaling is a really hard problem.<br>
-- The PM's goal = efficiently satisfying the true customer need, NOT the espoused customer need<br>
-- PM has limited power; must find ways to build legitimacy and influence outcomes, SO:<br>
==&gt; Develop rules that build trust but enforce tradeoffs<br>
==&gt; Develop rules that reflect the values and strategy of the organization (token allocation: should reflect company's strategy)</p>
<p>Ben Foster's comments:<br>
-- A real product roadmap (independent of contractual commitments) = critical to building advantage/staying ahead of competitors</p>
<p>-- PM's role: &quot;to make the product successful on the market --- period.&quot;<br>
Natural tension between developing good processes and necessary scrappiness/improvisation</p>
<p>-- Internal marketplace/token system: formalizes tradeoff between sales-driven development and product-driven development<br>
If you don't have a long-term product vision, your competitors will leapfrog you...</p>
<p>-- Platform strategy: if you don't want to do a ton of customization, figure out how your customers can build on top of your product.<br>
Can't say &quot;We don't support this&quot; --- Can say &quot;We solve this in a generic way by making it possible for you to customize/build on top of our product&quot; ==&gt; future-proofing!</p>
<p>-- OPOWER's customer is the consumer, not the utility.<br>
OPOWER: &quot;Allow us to focus on the consumer on your behalf.&quot; ==&gt; lets firm be a thought-leader rather than totally reactive to individual utility requirements</p>
<p>-- Technical debt is a hard problem.</p>
