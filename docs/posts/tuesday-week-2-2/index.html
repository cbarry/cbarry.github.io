<p>&quot;Jobs to be done&quot; model. Starbucks does two jobs: (1) Caffeine, stat! (fast, good, consistent coffee) (2) A place to sit down and talk with friends, think, or get work done. Starbucks was much cheaper for the customer than the previous alternatives (restaurants).</p>
<p>Organizational processes/structure makes decisions for the firm. Unilever rotates promising managers every 18-24 months to give them experience in many functional areas. How can they hold managers accountable for consequences over long time horizons?</p>
<p>Board meetings are convened &quot;on the back deck of the ship.&quot; A firm's board only sees &quot;the wake&quot; -- lagging indicators of performance. Think about how to find and track leading indicators (lowest-marginal customers, for example).</p>
<p>&quot;Data is heavy.&quot; Managers' natural tendency is to attempt to solve problems, not surface them. Thus, good data on performance/challenges does not tend to rise to the top of organizations.</p>
