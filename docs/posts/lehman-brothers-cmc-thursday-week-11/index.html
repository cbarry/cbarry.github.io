      <h1>Lehman Brothers (CMC, Thursday, Week 11)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-04-13">13 Apr 2012</time><a href="/tags/cmc/" class="post-tag">cmc</a>

<p>A German Jewish immigrant started a tiny grocery store in Montgomery, Alabama in 1844. Two of his brothers came over from Bavaria to join him. They called their business &quot;Lehman Brothers.&quot; Seriously. Their business went broke in 2008 -- the largest bankruptcy in American history. What the heck happened?</p>
<p>(Sidenote: William Sharpe -- creator of CAPM and the Sharpe ratio -- reminds us that there are still other brothers: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv4HQG2Hz0I">&quot;The wrong financial advisor&quot;</a>)</p>
<p>Middle men: Outsiders with an appetite for risk and the capability to deal with it</p>
<p>Why do merchants become investment bankers? Avenue to scale, industry/product-agnostic anyway, culture of apprenticeship</p>
<p>KFS for merchants: Competence, broad network, relationships, TRUST Why so many German Jews? Historical precedent, international connections, and serious consequences to breaking trust (ostracism in small community)</p>
<p>The evaluation of Lehman Brothers: Merchants =&gt; State bonds =&gt; Stocks/bonds =&gt; Investment funds =&gt; International expansion =&gt; Financial instruments Consistent trends: filling a void, provisioning capital to growth industries</p>
<p>The financial industry changes too: Professionalization, greater scale, CONSOLIDATION (many benefits; spurs growth) BUT: empire-building, declining competition, information asymmetry</p>
<p>Why do investment banks start off as partnerships? - Signal of commitment and diligence to customers =&gt; partners have skin in the game - Solves agency issues =&gt; no principal-agent problems - VALUE RESIDES IN HUMAN CAPITAL =&gt; What the heck is the &quot;capital&quot; that shareholders could own in a law firm or a consulting firm or an investment bank? The employees? They walk out the door at night...</p>
<p>What went wrong? - Technology &quot;makes human judgment redundant&quot; - Structural changes (public companies) - Competition on a transactional basis (vs. enduring relationships) - Managing risk through (purported) diversification =&gt; false sense of security? - GREED =&gt; downside borne by the public</p>
