      <h1>Lehman Brothers (CMC, Thursday, Week 11)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-04-13">13 Apr 2012</time><a href="/tags/coming-of-managerial-capitalism/" class="post-tag">coming-of-managerial-capitalism</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>A German Jewish immigrant started a tiny grocery store in Montgomery, Alabama in 1844. Two of his brothers came over from Bavaria to join him. They called their business &quot;Lehman Brothers.&quot; Seriously.<br>
Their business went broke in 2008 --- the largest bankruptcy in American history. What the heck happened?</p>
<p>(Sidenote: William Sharpe --- creator of CAPM and the Sharpe ratio --- reminds us that there are still other brothers:Â <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv4HQG2Hz0I">&quot;The wrong financial advisor&quot;</a>)</p>
<p>Middle men: Outsiders with an appetite for risk and the capability to deal with it</p>
<p>Why do merchants become investment bankers?<br>
Avenue to scale, industry/product-agnostic anyway, culture of apprenticeship</p>
<p>KFS for merchants: Competence, broad network, relationships, TRUST<br>
Why so many German Jews? Historical precedent, international connections, and serious consequences to breaking trust (ostracism in small community)</p>
<p>The evaluation of Lehman Brothers:<br>
Merchants =&gt; State bonds =&gt; Stocks/bonds =&gt; Investment funds =&gt; International expansion =&gt; Financial instruments<br>
Consistent trends: filling a void, provisioning capital to growth industries</p>
<p>The financial industry changes too: Professionalization, greater scale, CONSOLIDATION (many benefits; spurs growth)<br>
BUT: empire-building, declining competition, information asymmetry</p>
<p>Why do investment banks start off as partnerships?<br>
-- Signal of commitment and diligence to customers =&gt; partners have skin in the game<br>
-- Solves agency issues =&gt; no principal-agent problems<br>
-- VALUE RESIDES IN HUMAN CAPITAL =&gt; What the heck is the &quot;capital&quot; that shareholders could own in a law firm or a consulting firm or an investment bank? The employees? They walk out the door at night...</p>
<p>What went wrong?<br>
-- Technology &quot;makes human judgment redundant&quot;<br>
-- Structural changes (public companies)<br>
-- Competition on a transactional basis (vs. enduring relationships)<br>
-- Managing risk through (purported) diversification =&gt; false sense of security?<br>
-- GREED =&gt; downside borne by the public</p>
