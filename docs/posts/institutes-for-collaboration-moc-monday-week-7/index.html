<p>Institutes for Collaboration/Institutes for Strategic Competitiveness: the &quot;underbrush&quot; of market economies =&gt; not quite government...not quite firms, either...</p>
<p>Aeroplasticos in Colombia</p>
<p>(IFC in the developing world) Activities: lobbying, R&amp;D/tech services, conferences, data collection/benchmarking, strategic planning for cluster Accomplishments: drop tariffs, create tech institutions, exports and production increase, leading tradeshow KFS: wide membership, international collaboration (Germany), collective action</p>
<p>BUT: Is training adequate? Free-rider problems? Anti-competitive (too much collaboration)? Biggest backers/contributors usually have the most to gain (Hans Steinhauser, head of Formacol = Acoplasticos big booster)...</p>
<p>Takeaways: - It's really hard to measure success in developing economies. Acoplasticos is considered incredibly effective in Colombia. - Building IFCs: you still have to pick industries to develop/consider opportunity cost.</p>
<p>CSEM in Switzerland</p>
<p>(IFC in the developed world) Activities: creates new products, contract R&amp;D, spins out new startups 66 member firms! Startups compete with some of them... Works really well in Switzerland; might not work elsewhere.</p>
<p>Why do IFCs exist? Market imperfections =&gt; transaction costs, externalities, imperfect information, natural monopolies (in collecting industry data, for example) Government failure =&gt; inadequate provisioning of infrastructure</p>
<p>Developing-economy ISCs: greater tendency towards corrective &quot;gap filling&quot; Advanced-economy ISCs: usually focus on increasing coordination between firms, government, and universities</p>
