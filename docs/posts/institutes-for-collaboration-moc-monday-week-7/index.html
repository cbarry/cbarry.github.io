      <h1>Institutes for Collaboration (MOC, Monday, Week 7)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-03-07">07 Mar 2012</time><a href="/tags/microeconomics-of-competitiveness/" class="post-tag">microeconomics-of-competitiveness</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>Institutes for Collaboration/Institutes for Strategic Competitiveness: the &quot;underbrush&quot; of market economies<br>
=&gt; not quite government...not quite firms, either...</p>
<p>(IFC in the developing world)<br>
Activities: lobbying, R&amp;D/tech services, conferences, data collection/benchmarking, strategic planning for cluster<br>
Accomplishments: drop tariffs, create tech institutions, exports and production increase, leading tradeshow<br>
KFS: wide membership, international collaboration (Germany), collective action</p>
<p>BUT: Is training adequate? Free-rider problems? Anti-competitive (too much collaboration)? Biggest backers/contributors usually have the most to gain (Hans Steinhauser, head of Formacol = Acoplasticos big booster)...</p>
<p>Takeaways:<br>
-- It's really hard to measure success in developing economies. Acoplasticos is considered incredibly effective in Colombia.<br>
-- Building IFCs: you still have to pick industries to develop/consider opportunity cost.</p>
<p>(IFC in the developed world)<br>
Activities: creates new products, contract R&amp;D, spins out new startups<br>
66 member firms! Startups compete with some of them...<br>
Works really well in Switzerland; might not work elsewhere.</p>
<p>Why do IFCs exist?<br>
Market imperfections =&gt; transaction costs, externalities, imperfect information, natural monopolies (in collecting industry data, for example)<br>
Government failure =&gt; inadequate provisioning of infrastructure</p>
<p>Developing-economy ISCs: greater tendency towards corrective &quot;gap filling&quot;<br>
Advanced-economy ISCs: usually focus on increasing coordination between firms, government, and universities</p>
