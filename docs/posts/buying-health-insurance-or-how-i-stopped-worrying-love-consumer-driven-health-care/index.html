      <h1>Buying health insurance (or, How I Stopped Worrying and Love Consumer-Driven Health Care)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-06-28">28 Jun 2012</time><a href="/tags/insurance/" class="post-tag">insurance</a>

<p>This week, I returned to the working world after a two-year hiatus (vacation?) at the Harvard Business School.<br>
One of the myriad shocks of resuming full-time employment was that I now have to PAY for medical care. Ridiculous, I know.</p>
<p>I am fortunate enough to work at a fabulous, progressive healthcare software firm that offers its employees a choice of health insurance plans administered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, my state's largest insurer.</p>
<p>I'm afforded the opportunity to choose between three plans --- an HMO (they pick the doctors), a PPO (basically, pays 80% when you visit out-of-network doctors), and a more gnarly PPO with provisions for a Health Savings Account --- a sort of 401(K) plan for healthcare expenses.</p>
<p><em>Cue &quot;the paradox of choice&quot;</em><br>
On my first day of work, a plethora of paper slips and brochures and supplemental booklets (really --- dead trees!) explained the benefits afforded under each plan.<br>
There were lots of tables and footnotes and appendices.<br>
I had no idea which plan to choose.</p>
<p>But wait, you ask: how is this possible?<br>
Colin, you worry about healthcare for a living! (actually, healthcare information technology --- but whatever)<br>
How can you be totally bewildered by something as simple as how to insure yourself?<br>
I wondered this as well.</p>
<p>After I got over my initial feelings of shame, I started thinking about my bank account.<br>
In most matters I am a ridiculous cheapskate --- so I decided I should probably understand what I was buying.<br>
And because I am an MBA, &quot;understand what I was buying&quot; usually means a bunch of spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel.<br>
So without further ado, a several-part analysis of my health insurance options.</p>
<p>My options appear (based on some cursory and admittedly quick research) to be relatively typical of people employed by mid-sized companies in New England.</p>
<p>A caveat: I know a little something about exchanging clinical healthcare data. I am far from an expert in the insurance side of healthcare. I am not licensed to dispense advice about insurance decision-making. I have no particular desire to become a credible advisor on individual health insurance.<br>
So take my analysis with many grains of salt. If you buy healthcare based on a blog post, you're completely insane. Think about your particular situation yourself.</p>
<p><em>Background</em><br>
An HMO-style plan typically offers low premiums and a low deductible ($500), and assigns the patient to a primary-care physician. HMOs make it extremely expensive to visit out-of-network doctors --- generally, you'll pay out of pocket --- and attempt to deter emergency room visits in all but the most dire of circumstances.</p>
<p>In contrast, a PPO-style plan offers higher premiums and higher deductibles, but enable the patient more choice in picking doctors. The payer reimburses visits to out-of-network physicians at some pre-determined rate --- if you pick your own orthopedic surgeon, you'll pay 20% of the cost and the insurance company will pay 80%.</p>
<p>Effectively, PPO insurance is buying an option --- if you have some complex medical problem and you want treatment from the best doctor in your area, the insurance company will still pick up most of the tab.<br>
Also, PPOs generally involve less &quot;hassle&quot; --- if you fall down the stairs and you know you broke your leg, you can go straight to an orthopedic surgeon without first visiting a primary-care doc to confirm that, yes, your leg is actually broken.</p>
