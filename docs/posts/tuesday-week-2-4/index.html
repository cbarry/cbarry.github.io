<p>How banks work:<br>
-- Very asset intensive (huge balance sheet)<br>
-- &quot;Interest spread&quot; model flows through balance sheet and income statement<br>
-- Manage income statement for investors; manage balance sheet for regulators (esp. in a crisis). Natural tension...</p>
<p>Implications of fair-value accounting --- three kinds of assets:<br>
-- Held to maturity: held at historical cost, amortized, subject to impairment checks<br>
-- Available for sale: held at fair value, any changes hit the balance sheet as &quot;other comprehensive income&quot; ==&gt; Why? Because if your house doubles in value in a year ($200K to $400K), you didn't really earn $200K more income that year.<br>
-- Trading Assets: held at fair value, any changes flow through income statement ==&gt; Why? Because if your job is flipping real estate, you actually did earn $200K of income.</p>
<p>Three ways to assess fair value of assets (in order of increasing subjectivity):<br>
Level 1: unadjusted market price (equity in GE)<br>
Level 2: mark to model, disciplined by market input (some unique GE corporate bond; not exactly like traded securities but pretty close)<br>
Level 3: mark to model, unobservable inputs (claim on GE's future earnings from one particular project; no clear analogues)</p>
<p>Some managerial discretion in deciding which method to apply. Be wary if lots of assets valued via Level 3.</p>
<p>Regulatory requirements --- several ratios, big-picture takeaway:<br>
Numerator = most kinds of equity (net of intangible assets and goodwill)<br>
Denominator = risk-adjusted assets</p>
<p>How do banks get through crises:<br>
-- Sell assets (problem: prices are usually bad)<br>
-- Raise capital (problem: usually especially costly)<br>
-- Cosmetics (sell appreciated assets and immediately replace them; re-classify; etc.)</p>
