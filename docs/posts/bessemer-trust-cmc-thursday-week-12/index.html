      <h1>Bessemer Trust (CMC, Thursday, Week 12)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-04-19">19 Apr 2012</time><a href="/tags/coming-of-managerial-capitalism/" class="post-tag">coming-of-managerial-capitalism</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>Andrew Carnegie and Henry Phipps made some steel and got really rich. Carnegie built 3,000 libraries (and a lake for Princeton's crew team). Phipps started a trust to pay dividends to his descendants. Who did the most for America? (Carnegie, duh.)</p>
<p>The Carnegie philosophy<br>
Society benefits from wealth accumulation =&gt; rich people have smarts and wherewithal to do &quot;great things&quot; for the community with lots of money. And they have a responsibility to do those things.<br>
Rich people shouldn't live lavishly; some proportion should stay in family (maybe)<br>
Pro-estate tax =&gt; enforcement mechanism to ensure that the wealthy use their money for the betterment of the community. No &quot;landed gentry.&quot;<br>
In sum: noblesse oblige (with more than a hint of rich-guy paternalism)</p>
<p>Problems:<br>
Nice sentiment, hard to implement (hi Donald Trump) --- objectively, mega-rich people tend to buy more yachts than libraries<br>
Ignores aspirational element of wealth accumulation (people get rich to pass on nice things to their children)<br>
For whom should wealthy people do good? How should they allocate their wealth?</p>
<p>The Phipps philosophy<br>
Creates intricate trust; wealth for consumption and administration/investment --- in perpetuity.<br>
Preaches moderation in consumption; behavioral guidelines for family<br>
&quot;Stewards of capital;&quot; creates professional wealth management organization<br>
Bessemer Investment Company funds creation of dozens of firms; invests in the future of America; supports economic growth</p>
<p>Problems:<br>
Persistent income disparity; increasing concentration of capital<br>
No mention of society --- don't rich people have an obligation to give back?<br>
Arbitrary capture of massive asset-base by a single family --- is this &quot;American?&quot;</p>
