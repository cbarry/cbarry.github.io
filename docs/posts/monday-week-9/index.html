<p>Delicate balance between learning, speed, and focus in new ventures (via Ash Maurya, &quot;Running Lean&quot;)<br>
<img src="http://ash.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/speed-learning-focus.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Formula for product dev:<br>
(1) Before you build anything, test against target customers with visuals (storyboards, drawings, prototypes).<br>
(2) Understand your &quot;core&quot; (sustainable competitive advantage; whatever you're building your business on the back of).<br>
(3) Identify most important assumptions.<br>
(4) Identify quickest way to test your assumptions.<br>
This is your Minimum Viable Product.<br>
If you assemble/test this early, it is much easier and cheaper to pivot. Cost and complexity of pivots increases quickly.</p>
<p>You can outsource everything else, but you need to do your &quot;core&quot; functions yourself.</p>
<p>How to sell products before you have products:<br>
Make a product brochure with:<br>
-- Features (technology)<br>
-- Functions (how product fits in to customer's job responsibilities)<br>
-- Benefits (how product is faster, cheaper, or better than alternatives)<br>
Then sell vaporware based on your product brochure.<br>
Only complication: it's hard to change your product after you've sold it. Need to make sure you're not producing a custom, one-off solution to appeal to a single customer.</p>
<p>PT Games MVP (Microsoft Kinect for physical therapy/rehab)<br>
Making a Kinect game as an MVP would have been super-expensive. Alternative?<br>
-- Make a video of physical therapy, hand out instead of paper directions. Test hypothesis that people will care about/use technology solutions for physical therapy.<br>
-- If people watch the video, then install webcam to enable physical therapist to watch sessions. Test hypothesis that trainers will care about their clients' compliance/exercise habits.<br>
-- THEN, only if hypotheses are confirmed, built a basic Kinect game and do iterative testing.</p>
