<p>How did this happen? Prohibition blurs the lines between legal and illegal. Everyone wants to drink booze, and we made it illegal... Lack of opportunity for urban poor Massive population boom in Chicago; government doesn't mature/scale up accordingly Price war dynamic/cartel instability =&gt; violence as enforcement mechanism</p>
<p>Elements of the Capone organization: U-Form/matrix (regional) structure Consolidated/formal Board of Directors Sophisticated segmentation by roles Personal/family connections Criminals AND non-criminals Relies on loyalty and code of values (silence) Risk management, succession planning</p>
<p>Economics of Capone's empire are not that great =&gt; ~4% net margins, $30M of police payoffs (half of Chicago police force on Capone's payroll!) =&gt; Problems with scaling up: geographic expansion still requires paying off local government Still one of the wealthiest Americans in the late 1920s...</p>
