<p>HBR business model: - Capitalize on Harvard brand! - Top-notch contributors - Long articles, not just tidbits So: higher price than competitors, lower circulation (vs. Economist, FT, Fortune).</p>
<p>Why go online? - Cheaper lead generation (vs. offline) - More current content (vs. offline), additional revenue (freemium)? - Searchability (past issues) - Content testing (try out covers before they get printed) - Let readers meet each other??</p>
<p>Big takeaways: - Firms have an initial tendency to think of social media as a one-way dialogue. - &quot;Meet&quot; is always easier to monetize than &quot;friend&quot; -- usually have to find indirect ways to profit from friend platforms.</p>
<p>HBR's reflections on key factors for success: (1) Experimentation: Easy to talk about having a culture of experimentation; really hard to actually do it. (2) Success Metrics: Without some concrete performance criteria, it's hard to know how well things are working. (3) Know When to Pull the Plug: It's really hard to declare that a project has failed, but it's important to end experiments that don't work. Otherwise, you can't experiment...</p>
