<p>HBR business model:<br>
-- Capitalize on Harvard brand!<br>
-- Top-notch contributors<br>
-- Long articles, not just tidbits<br>
So: higher price than competitors, lower circulation (vs. Economist, FT, Fortune).</p>
<p>Why go online?<br>
-- Cheaper lead generation (vs. offline)<br>
-- More current content (vs. offline), additional revenue (freemium)?<br>
-- Searchability (past issues)<br>
-- Content testing (try out covers before they get printed)<br>
-- Let readers meet each other??</p>
<p>Big takeaways:<br>
-- Firms have an initial tendency to think of social media as a one-way dialogue.<br>
-- &quot;Meet&quot; is always easier to monetize than &quot;friend&quot; --- usually have to find indirect ways to profit from friend platforms.</p>
<p>HBR's reflections on key factors for success:<br>
(1) Experimentation: Easy to talk about having a culture of experimentation; really hard to actually do it.<br>
(2) Success Metrics: Without some concrete performance criteria, it's hard to know how well things are working.<br>
(3) Know When to Pull the Plug: It's really hard to declare that a project has failed, but it's important to end experiments that don't work. Otherwise, you can't experiment...</p>
