<p>Why did the VC model arise post-WWII? - Hard for small, risky firms to access capital =&gt; banks won't lend - Revenue Act of 1940 =&gt; higher taxes, probably doesn't deter investment but greater need for individual investors to pool risk - US Government funding for war R&amp;D =&gt; de-risks follow-on investment - US Government created wartime partnerships between universities and industry - GI Bill =&gt; higher ed is more broadly accessible</p>
<p>Georges Doriot: HBS professor, American soldier, visionary investor - Firm believer in possibility of managing entrepreneurship - Dispenses money AND advice - Already had created a pool of analysts (HBS students) - &quot;Central node&quot; =&gt; deep industry connections, networker - Portfolio theory</p>
<p>American Research and Development Corporation (ARD) - founded in 1946 - Shifts industry focus with the times: chemicals =&gt; diverse sector choices =&gt; electronics - Access to capital: lots of individual investors, permanent fund (closed-end) - Portfolio management: takes controlling stake in enterprises and actively manages (board seats) - Capital gains and consulting fees (looks more like contemporary PE, but they also started off with less risky investments/more hits than modern VC)</p>
<p>The big deal about ARD: foresight to invest on an unproven thesis Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC): ARD invests in 1957, IPO in 1961, 81% IRR/375x returns over 10 years. Proves the model...</p>
<p>Subsequent evolution in VC firm structure: ARD: - sells shares at Net Asset Value on public markets (like an ETF) - investors have liquidity via secondary market - General Partners are salaried</p>
<p>Limited Partnerships: - 10 year fund lifetime (usually), limited liquidity - GPs earn fee (2%) and carried interest (20%) - Unequal distribution of fund upside among GPs (older GPs make more, usually) BUT hard to retain good GPs; easy to break off and start another fund once you have a reputation...</p>
<p>Increasingly, trend away from &quot;royalty model&quot; of compensation and towards &quot;insurance model&quot; - Junior partners see a piece of the upside - Decreases attrition of good GPs, allows VC firms to build a brand. Helps explain persistence of returns??</p>
