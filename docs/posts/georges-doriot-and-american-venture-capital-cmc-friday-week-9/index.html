<p>Why did the VC model arise post-WWII?<br>
-- Hard for small, risky firms to access capital =&gt; banks won't lend<br>
-- Revenue Act of 1940 =&gt; higher taxes, probably doesn't deter investment but greater need for individual investors to pool risk<br>
-- US Government funding for war R&amp;D =&gt; de-risks follow-on investment<br>
-- US Government created wartime partnerships between universities and industry<br>
-- GI Bill =&gt; higher ed is more broadly accessible</p>
<p>Georges Doriot: HBS professor, American soldier, visionary investor<br>
-- Firm believer in possibility of managing entrepreneurship<br>
-- Dispenses money AND advice<br>
-- Already had created a pool of analysts (HBS students)<br>
-- &quot;Central node&quot; =&gt; deep industry connections, networker<br>
-- Portfolio theory</p>
<p>American Research and Development Corporation (ARD) -- founded in 1946<br>
-- Shifts industry focus with the times: chemicals =&gt; diverse sector choices =&gt; electronics<br>
-- Access to capital: lots of individual investors, permanent fund (closed-end)<br>
-- Portfolio management: takes controlling stake in enterprises and actively manages (board seats)<br>
-- Capital gains and consulting fees (looks more like contemporary PE, but they also started off with less risky investments/more hits than modern VC)</p>
<p>The big deal about ARD: foresight to invest on an unproven thesis<br>
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC): ARD invests in 1957, IPO in 1961, 81% IRR/375x returns over 10 years.<br>
Proves the model...</p>
<p>Subsequent evolution in VC firm structure:<br>
ARD:<br>
-- sells shares at Net Asset Value on public markets (like an ETF)<br>
-- investors have liquidity via secondary market<br>
-- General Partners are salaried</p>
<p>Limited Partnerships:<br>
-- 10 year fund lifetime (usually), limited liquidity<br>
-- GPs earn fee (2%) and carried interest (20%)<br>
-- Unequal distribution of fund upside among GPs (older GPs make more, usually)<br>
BUT hard to retain good GPs; easy to break off and start another fund once you have a reputation...</p>
<p>Increasingly, trend away from &quot;royalty model&quot; of compensation and towards &quot;insurance model&quot;<br>
-- Junior partners see a piece of the upside<br>
-- Decreases attrition of good GPs, allows VC firms to build a brand. Helps explain persistence of returns??</p>
