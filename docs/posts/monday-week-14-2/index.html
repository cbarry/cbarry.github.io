      <h1>Optional Firing Workshop (FD, Monday, Week 14)</h1>

<p>-- Context for early-stage companies is different<br>
=&gt; Typically not the same &quot;runway&quot; for employees to improve as large firms<br>
=&gt; Typically a lot more firings</p>
<p>-- Two types of firing: performance-related vs. direction/fit-related<br>
-- Neither should come as a surprise. Do quarterly reviews, other good management practices.</p>
<p>FIRING SOMEONE<br>
Where: Conference room, no interior windows<br>
When: Early in the week, late in the day<br>
Who: Manager plus one other &quot;company voice&quot; (HR, COO, CFO, etc.)<br>
What: All paperwork ready in advance; have answers to any conceivable question<br>
How: Get straight to the point.<br>
-- Don't get involved in deep conversation or debate.<br>
-- Stick to observables, not impressions.<br>
-- Do make confirming remarks about former employee's character if relevant (&quot;appreciate your hard work,&quot; &quot;value your dedication,&quot; etc.)<br>
-- Emphasize finality.</p>
<p>Other thoughts:<br>
-- Threat of termination is a slippery slope.<br>
-- Don't drag it out.<br>
-- Think about what you want out of the former employee, post-departure. It's probably not &quot;nothing.&quot;<br>
-- Don't tell other employees that someone their co-worker was fired; tell them his/her last day was XXX (maybe exceptions for felony). &quot;Circumstances surrounding his/her departure were personal and confidential&quot; or something.<br>
Would you want other people to know that you were fired, or what you were fired for? No.</p>
