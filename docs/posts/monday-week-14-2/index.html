<p>- Context for early-stage companies is different =&gt; Typically not the same &quot;runway&quot; for employees to improve as large firms =&gt; Typically a lot more firings</p>
<p>- Two types of firing: performance-related vs. direction/fit-related - Neither should come as a surprise. Do quarterly reviews, other good management practices.</p>
<p>FIRING SOMEONE Where: Conference room, no interior windows When: Early in the week, late in the day Who: Manager plus one other &quot;company voice&quot; (HR, COO, CFO, etc.) What: All paperwork ready in advance; have answers to any conceivable question How: Get straight to the point. - Don't get involved in deep conversation or debate. - Stick to observables, not impressions. - Do make confirming remarks about former employee's character if relevant (&quot;appreciate your hard work,&quot; &quot;value your dedication,&quot; etc.) - Emphasize finality.</p>
<p>Other thoughts: - Threat of termination is a slippery slope. - Don't drag it out. - Think about what you want out of the former employee, post-departure. It's probably not &quot;nothing.&quot; - Don't tell other employees that someone their co-worker was fired; tell them his/her last day was XXX (maybe exceptions for felony). &quot;Circumstances surrounding his/her departure were personal and confidential&quot; or something. Would you want other people to know that you were fired, or what you were fired for? No.</p>
