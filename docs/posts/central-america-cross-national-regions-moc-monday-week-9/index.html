      <h1>Central America / Cross-National Regions (MOC, Monday, Week 9)</h1>

<p>New model of regional economic cooperation: more than just free trade areas. Regional strategy can: improve investment climate, expand available markets, drive better business environment, enable effective transnational clusters. Particularly important for small countries with lots of natural disasters...</p>
<p>But, CACM in Central America fails: - Conceived to further import substitution agenda; all sorts of problems - Requires member countries to give up national sovereignty in impractical ways</p>
<p>Some progress with CAA, but still slow going/stalled: - Biggest successes: low-hanging fruit (investment promotion, coordinate tourism) - Cultural integrity across Central American nations? Not all it's cracked up to be; still huge disparities in economic development, policy goals, and motivation. AND unstable political landscape. - Degree of buy-in may vary -- Honduras doesn't get much out of the Central American Logistical Corridor.</p>
<p>Great potential for gains from strategizing with neighbors, but challenging to implement...</p>
