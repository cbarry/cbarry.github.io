      <h1>Amazon in 2000 (BAV, Monday, Week 4)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-02-15">15 Feb 2012</time><a href="/tags/business-analysis-and-valuation/" class="post-tag">business-analysis-and-valuation</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>Amazon in late 2000: expanding like crazy, minority stakes in many startups (<a href="http://pets.com">pets.com</a>, <a href="http://drugstore.com">drugstore.com</a>, etc.), extremely hard to tell whether they're a doomed tech shell game or a sly game-changer.</p>
<p>Ravi Suria: Increasing competition (B&amp;N, Borders), negative FCF, out of cash in the next six months and unable to service debt.<br>
Amazon: No way.<br>
Broader context =&gt; Post-bubble burst, tension between equity and credit analysts, potential incentive to write contrarian reports. All of Suria's research uses publicly-available information...so why does stock price plunge 15% after report's release?</p>
<p>Assessing progress via financial statements is really hard if a firm is growing rapidly. Especially with operating leases and aggressive goodwill amortization (not really an issue anymore...).\</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One argument: you could just look at Amazon's operating metrics. LTV &gt; CAC. BUT Amazon is trying to change customer behavior.<br>
Fundamental thesis = customer service and satisfaction will differentiate Amazon; e-commerce will not spur ruthless competition on price alone. Obviously true in hindsight; not at all obvious at the time. Secular hypotheses are hard to evaluate.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about seasonality: Suria extrapolates AMZN's drop in payables post-Christmas forward to the whole year. Doesn't make sense; AMZN is paying merchants for XMas wares. The machine is built around negative NWC --- growth generates cash.</p>
