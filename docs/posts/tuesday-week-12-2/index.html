<p>Best class guests/case protagonists ever...</p>
<p>Takeaways from negotiation:<br>
-- Open with &quot;congratulations&quot; (or something positive).<br>
-- If you are an acquirer, don't ever be a bidder in an auction. Figure out creative/non-financial/hard to value terms, ideally ones that don't do crazy things to the other party's incentives. Do anything you can to make the conversation about something other than price.<br>
-- Multiple bidders =&gt; higher valuation (duh)<br>
-- In M&amp;A, there are some features of the buyer that will always shape the deal/it's not just about price.<br>
Examples: Pepsi can't credibly claim that they won't change a company's &quot;entrepreneurial culture&quot; upon acquisition. Ocean Spray (a co-op) can't offer acquiree's founders a piece of the upside --- it's a coop; there's no publicly-traded equity. Triarc can't credibly claim that they'll tolerate gradual growth or unprofitability --- it's a PE shop; they want to exit with a double-digit IRR in 5-8 years.</p>
<p>The aftermath:<br>
-- Get a fabulous lawyer when you exit. Tom &amp; Tom missed earnout milestones, regretted selling to Ocean Spray within six months of closing, and still got paid because they had good lawyers.</p>
<p>&quot;We were ready to take the next step (getting liquidity), but not ready to give up the company.&quot; -- Tom First<br>
Epilogue: Pepsi control sounded great after six months working for Ocean Spray.</p>
<p>&quot;Our abilities were a subset of our desires.&quot; -- Tom Scott</p>
<p>On entrepreneurs at big companies (Ocean Spray vs. Pepsi):<br>
&quot;If you can't get the things that you need as a human, just take the money.&quot; -- Tom Scott</p>
<p>&quot;We got a call from Triarc, from Nelson Peltz. And he said we could meet anywhere in the world as long as it was within five miles of a helipad...I just remember the whole thing feeling dirty.&quot; -- Tom First, on the possibility of selling Nantucket Nectars to PE</p>
