<p>Khosla Ventures approach to cleantech: attempting to build cleantech infrastructure, a la business groups in emerging markets <a href="http://www.khoslaventures.com/">Khosla Ventures website</a> has a lot of resources for cleantech entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Factors to examine in valuation: - Growth projections =&gt; Will this venture's revenues grow like retail (slow) or like Internet retail (fast) - Cash flows =&gt; future CAPEX requirements per strategic plan (not much bricks-and-mortar required), structure of cash flows (negative Operating Working Capital; CSN gets paid before they pay suppliers). - Revenue composition =&gt; traditional merchant (Amazon; where firm is the merchant of record, and revenues = sales) vs. intermediary (eBay; where firm connects buyer and seller, and revenues = % of transaction)</p>
<p>Thinking about optimizing your spend on online advertising: &quot;We're not increasing the number of customers, we're increasing our customer's total lifetime value/decreasing our spend on advertising.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;SEO... It's kind of a black art, so you can't really build a business off it.&quot; - Steve Conine, CSN Stores</p>
