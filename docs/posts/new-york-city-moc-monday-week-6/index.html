<p>Strategy requires distilling your vision into something other than a 72-item list. You need priorities and sequencing. &quot;You will never be really effective by minimizing your weaknesses.&quot; - Porter</p>
<p>How did NYC become the leading metropolis in the US? - Great endowments =&gt; natural harbor, halfway up East Coast, early trading hub, history of diversity/openness (NOT a Puritan colony) - Scale/critical mass - Quality of life</p>
<p>True prosperity comes from productive use of endowments, not just great endowments. Country/region/city needs a distinctive positive identity that will inspire its citizens.</p>
<p>Political will to implement policy choices = huge challenge. Change takes a long time, and policy-makers need to be capable of lasting commitment, consistent direction, and endurance. Often a huge challenge -- election cycles are short.</p>
<p>Zoning =&gt; big lever for local government; lets you raise/lower density and preserve industrial spaces</p>
<p>Huge problem moving forward: Pension costs &gt; salary costs for city workers</p>
