      <h1>LinkedIn / Valuation of High-Growth Firms (BAV, Monday, Week 11)</h1>

<p>How much is LinkedIn worth? We have no idea.</p>
<p>Revenue streams Recruiters: access to user data, $ for job postings Advertisers: targeted ads (favorable member demographics) Premium membership: additional features</p>
<p>Key factors for success: - Leadership in professional networking; network-effects business - HR is a huge industry - Growth in member base, successful outreach to corporate customers</p>
<p>Risks: - International expansion: two entrenched competitors - User engagement: low versus Facebook (maybe) - Hard to open up data to third parties (advertising is not as easy on professional sites) - Existing job boards (<a href="http://Monster.com">Monster.com</a>)</p>
<p>So how do we do a valuation?</p>
<p>Multiples: - Some rough comparables, but is OpenTable really a good comp for LinkedIn? - Metrics are bad -- EBITDA/FCF are less meaningful for rapidly-growing firms - Base year -- huge differences between 2010 and 2011 financials NOT GOOD.</p>
<p>Fundamentals (Abnormal earnings): - Highly sensitive to revenue growth -- how well can we estimate this? - Uncertain margins -- revenue streams have different margins, and it's not clear which will be significant in the future - Unclear beta -- sensitive to business cycle? mitigated by subscription model?</p>
<p>Takeaway: It is really hard to evaluate early-stage companies. Most of the value lies in expectations, and the firm has clear incentives to hype.</p>
<p>How to spot a bubble/mis-pricing: - Ask yourself: Are the expectations embedded in this price realistic? If LinkedIn has to capture 90% of global HR market, probably yes. If LinkedIn has to capture 2% of global HR market, maybe no. - What will a good comparable be in 10 years? Is this a winner-take-all market?</p>
