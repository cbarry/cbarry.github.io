      <h1>LinkedIn / Valuation of High-Growth Firms (BAV, Monday, Week 11)</h1>

<time datetime="2012-04-10">10 Apr 2012</time><a href="/tags/business-analysis-and-valuation/" class="post-tag">business-analysis-and-valuation</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>How much is LinkedIn worth? We have no idea.</p>
<p>Revenue streams<br>
Recruiters: access to user data, $ for job postings<br>
Advertisers: targeted ads (favorable member demographics)<br>
Premium membership: additional features</p>
<p>Key factors for success:<br>
-- Leadership in professional networking; network-effects business<br>
-- HR is a huge industry<br>
-- Growth in member base, successful outreach to corporate customers</p>
<p>Risks:<br>
-- International expansion: two entrenched competitors<br>
-- User engagement: low versus Facebook (maybe)<br>
-- Hard to open up data to third parties (advertising is not as easy on professional sites)<br>
-- Existing job boards (<a href="http://Monster.com">Monster.com</a>)</p>
<p>So how do we do a valuation?</p>
<p>Multiples:<br>
-- Some rough comparables, but is OpenTable really a good comp for LinkedIn?<br>
-- Metrics are bad --- EBITDA/FCF are less meaningful for rapidly-growing firms<br>
-- Base year --- huge differences between 2010 and 2011 financials<br>
NOT GOOD.</p>
<p>Fundamentals (Abnormal earnings):<br>
-- Highly sensitive to revenue growth --- how well can we estimate this?<br>
-- Uncertain margins --- revenue streams have different margins, and it's not clear which will be significant in the future<br>
-- Unclear beta --- sensitive to business cycle? mitigated by subscription model?</p>
<p>Takeaway: It is really hard to evaluate early-stage companies. Most of the value lies in expectations, and the firm has clear incentives to hype.</p>
<p>How to spot a bubble/mis-pricing:<br>
-- Ask yourself: Are the expectations embedded in this price realistic?<br>
If LinkedIn has to capture 90% of global HR market, probably yes.<br>
If LinkedIn has to capture 2% of global HR market, maybe no.<br>
-- What will a good comparable be in 10 years? Is this a winner-take-all market?</p>
