      <h1>Merrill Lynch/RPP Model (BSSE, Wednesday, Week 2)</h1>

<time datetime="2011-09-08">08 Sep 2011</time><a href="/tags/building-and-sustaining-successful-enterprises/" class="post-tag">building-and-sustaining-successful-enterprises</a><a href="/tags/year-two/" class="post-tag">year-two</a>

<p>The RPP model for thinking about firms:<br>
Resources = people, technology, equipment, cash = &quot;what we have&quot;<br>
Processes = &quot;what we do&quot;<br>
Priorities = &quot;the formula we use to create profit&quot;</p>
<p>Key question: Is our past success due to the resources or the processes?<br>
Contemporary example: Steve Jobs is leaving Apple. Is Apple doomed? If their success is due to resources --- Steve Jobs' innate ability to make products that blow up --- then they will have to replace a unique resource, which will be hard. If their success is due to processes --- a set of linkages and workflows that generate products that blow up --- then they might not have to replace much.</p>
<p>There are no disruptive technologies, only disruptive business models. Even technologies that would appear to completely &quot;change the game&quot; can often be integrated into a firm's existing processes and priorities --- as sustaining innovations.<br>
Example: Merrill Lynch and the dawn of the Internet. Merrill initially stays out of online brokerage game/robust customer portal game and uses the web to give wealth managers and other employees better data on their clients' positions, demographics, etc. Its customers aren't really lured in by $10 transaction fees; they're not looking to save a few bucks per trade. A sustaining innovation.</p>
