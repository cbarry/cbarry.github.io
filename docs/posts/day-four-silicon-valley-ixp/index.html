<p>Shopkick company visit (Doug Galen, Chief Revenue Officer)<br>
<a href="../../img/IMG_0549.jpg"><img src="../../img/IMG_0549-300x224.jpg" alt="" title="shopkicking"></a><br>
&quot;Each one of my jobs has been --- in my own definition --- a holy crusade.&quot;<br>
=&gt; eBay = little guys vs. big guy in retail<br>
=&gt; Shutterfly = photo storage for a new dad<br>
=&gt; Shopkick = the retail experience is bad; technology can make it personal</p>
<p>On career moves:<br>
-- Do informational interviews until the cows come home.<br>
-- Think about your personal pitch: &quot;I'm the real estate guy who can make things happen on the Internet&quot; vs. &quot;I know a ton about commercial real estate.&quot;</p>
<p>Biz dev (or, how a dinky Silicon Valley startup does a deal with Citi)<br>
(1) Use your network to get the right intros: board members, friends, colleagues. Cold-calls can work, but they have a low probability of success.<br>
(2) Be relentless.<br>
(3) Have passion and conviction about your idea.</p>
<p>Staging a launch: Shopkick needed to prove that people would use it. Testing validated their hypothesis, but also made them realize that people would try to game the system (vast majority of check-ins were fraudulent).</p>
<p>Shopkick's critical mix: sticky (personalized), rewarding (builds brand loyalty), fun.<br>
Ruled out any features/decisions that did not obviously benefit consumers. Users don't like being exploited. And why are you in business anyway? Probably not to take advantage of your customers.</p>
<p>Designing a product that fits into existing behavior: look at absolutely every asset/behavior =&gt; the microphone on a smartphone</p>
<p>Shopkick did not execute Lean. Problems with small-scale testing/limited commitment from customers:<br>
-- It takes big companies forever to scale up investment<br>
-- Without skin in the game, customers wouldn't put real muscle behind product roll-out.</p>
<p>Shopkick retail partners: actual purchasing decision always ended up at CEO or CMO level. Great for getting buy-in, but makes the selling process a lot more challenging.</p>
<p>Lessons from <a href="http://TheFunded.com">TheFunded.com</a> (Adeo Ressi)<br>
&quot;Your job is to kill bad ideas.&quot;<br>
(Also, &quot;What was that nod you gave me?!?&quot;)</p>
<p>Adeo's seven rules:<br>
-- Simple ideas win. (Complex ideas die)<br>
One company, one product, one revenue source</p>
<p>-- You have one revenue stream. (Or a bad business)<br>
And the steps to revenue should be few (partner arrangements don't usually work).</p>
<p>-- Name your ideal customer. (And befriend them)</p>
<p>-- Make something explainable. (In 10 words or less)</p>
<p>-- Small markets suck. (And you will die winning them. Because it's not energizing/fun.)</p>
<p>-- Mix in some secret sauce. (To show that you're an expert)<br>
Example: B2C secret sauce tends to be around user acquisition.</p>
<p>-- Be original. (By being new or better)</p>
<p>Additional takeaways:<br>
-- Don't name your company something that you yourself cannot pronounce.<br>
-- Don't name your company something that is difficult to spell.<br>
-- Avoid buzzwords (or at least be able to pitch your idea without them).</p>
<p>Product Management (Marty Cagan)<br>
&quot;Our job is to invent on behalf of the user.&quot; -- Jeff Bezos<br>
(1) Obsess over your customers. Become the undisputed expert on them. If you're not meeting with three of them per week, you're wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;No facts exist inside the building; only opinions.&quot; -- Steve Blank<br>
(2) Distinguish vision from illusion.</p>
<p>&quot;If you continue to improve a product enough, you'll eventually ruin it.&quot; -- David Pogue<br>
(3) Define success. Know what you are trying to accomplish; have a scorecard for your product.</p>
<p>(4) Embrace user experience. Design is how it all works, not just how it looks.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't fall in love.&quot;<br>
Get customer feedback every two weeks at least; avoid getting attached to ideas.</p>
<p>(5) Fail fast. Make product discovery the core competency of your product function.<br>
Do A/B testing to prove/disprove that something works. Do customer observation to figure out why something works (or doesn't work).</p>
<p>(6) Ensure true collaboration (between product manager, designer, and developer).</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing is what happens when too many people have to agree.&quot; -- Seth Godin<br>
(7) Improve fast. Products should be viable, usable, and feasible (compare to Ideo).</p>
<p>(8) Be agile. Build and deploy incrementally, but have a compelling overall vision.</p>
<p>(9) Demand excellence. Worry about every pixel.<br>
Someone's first experience meeting Jeff Bezos: Bezos on top of a desk in his office yelling, &quot;Someone get me a gun so I can shoot myself so that I don't have to face our customers after we expose them to this product.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any company that has something called an Innovation Lab --- there's probably a problem.&quot; -- Cagan (ouch)</p>
<p>Hackers and Founders event (Tom Eisenmann and Ben Horowitz [Netscape, LoudCloud, Andreessen Horowitz])<br>
Classic MBA problems:<br>
-- Delusional sense of competence<br>
-- Sense of entitlement<br>
-- Wrong kind of ambition (hungry for yourself, not hungry for the company)</p>
<p>On Lean Startup: Part of finding your product market is figuring out how to sell the product.<br>
&quot;It turns out, selling things is hard.&quot; -- Ben Horowitz</p>
<p>People think that the best technology always wins. Actually, the best technology doesn't always win (example: Oracle). But the winning product becomes the best technology, because they make all the money and hire the best engineers.</p>
<p>Life in a startup:<br>
&quot;I find you only experience two emotions --- terror and euphoria --- and the lack of sleep enhances them both.&quot;</p>
<p>On companies with long-term vision:<br>
Think about the 20th employee. Because he or she is not getting any equity, but you need to be able to emotionally move people enough to attract someone good.<br>
This resonated with me a lot (example: athenahealth).</p>
